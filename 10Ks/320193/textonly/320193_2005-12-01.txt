(Apple or the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on January 3, 1977. The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and television shows. The Companys products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve G5 server and Xserve RAID storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Music Store, a portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value added resellers. The Company also sells a variety of third-party products that are compatible with the Companys Macintosh and iPod product lines, including computer printers and printing supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital camcorders and still cameras, personal digital assistants, iPod accessories, and various other computing products and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented in this Form 10-K is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. Business Strategy The Company is committed to bringing the best personal computing and music experience to students, educators, creative professionals, businesses, government agencies, and consumers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to facilitate innovation of new and improved products and technologies. Besides updates to its existing line of personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions, the Company continues to capitalize on the convergence of digital consumer electronics and the computer by creating innovations like the iPod and iTunes Music Store. The Companys strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more of its targeted customers and provide them a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience. Digital Hub The Company believes personal computing is in an era in which the personal computer functions for both professionals and consumers as the digital hub for advanced new digital devices such as the Companys  1    iPod digital music players, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, digital camcorders and still cameras, CD and DVD players, televisions, and other consumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer include a high quality user interface, relatively inexpensive data storage, and the ability to run complex applications and easily connect to the Internet. Apple is the only company in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire personal computerfrom the hardware and operating system to sophisticated applications. Additionally, the Companys products provide innovative industrial design, intuitive ease-of-use, and built-in networking, graphics and multimedia capabilities. Thus, the Company is uniquely positioned to offer integrated digital hub products and solutions. The Company develops products and technologies that adhere to many industry standards in order to provide an optimized user experience through interoperability with peripherals and devices from other companies. The Company has played a role in the development, enhancement, promotion, and/or use of numerous of these industry standards. Expanded Distribution The Company believes that a high quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Companys products and services is critical to attracting and retaining customers. The Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which consists of the deployment of Apple employees and contractors to selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Macintosh computer and other products over those of its competitors. The Company has significantly increased the points of distribution for the iPod product family in order to make its products available at locations where its customers shop. From inception of the retail initiative in 2001 through 2005, the Company had opened 116 retail stores in the U.S. and 8 international stores in Canada, Japan, and the U.K. The Company opened 2 additional stores in October 2005.  The Company has typically located its stores at high traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. One of the goals of the retail initiative is to bring new customers to the Company and expand its installed base through sales to computer users who currently do not own a Macintosh computer and first time personal computer buyers. By operating its own stores and building them in desirable high traffic locations, the Company is able to better control the customer retail experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of personal computing products. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes in order to accommodate market demands. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice and certain hardware support services. The stores offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and various other computing products and supplies selected to complement the Companys own products. Additionally, the stores provide a forum in which the Company is able to present computing solutions to users in areas such as digital photography, digital video, music, childrens software, and home and small business computing. Education For more than 25 years, the Company has focused on the use of technology in education and has been committed to delivering tools to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement, especially when used to support collaboration, information access, and the expression and representation  2    of student thought and ideas. The Company creates solutions that enable new modes of curriculum delivery, better ways of conducting research, and opportunities for professional development of faculty, students, and staff. The Company has designed a range of products and services to help schools maximize their investments in technology. This is manifested in many of the Companys products and services that are designed to meet the needs of education customers. These products and services include the eMac, iMac, and the iBook®, video creation and editing solutions, wireless networking, student information systems,  high-quality curriculum and professional development solutions, and one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions (primarily in K-12). 1:1 learning solutions typically consist of iBook portable computers for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. Creative Professionals Creative professionals constitute one of the Companys most important markets for both hardware and software products. This market is also important to many third-party developers who provide Macintosh-compatible hardware and software solutions. Creative customers utilize the Companys products for a variety of creative activities including digital video and film production and editing; digital video and film special effects, compositing, and titling; digital still photography and workflow management; graphic design, publishing, and print production; music creation and production; audio production and sound design; and web design, development, and administration. The Company designs its high-end hardware solutions, including servers, desktops, and portable Macintosh systems, to incorporate the power, expandability, and features desired by creative professionals. The Companys operating system, Mac OS X, incorporates powerful graphics and audio technologies and features developer tools to optimize system and application performance when running powerful creative solutions provided by the Company or third-party developers. The Company also offers various software solutions to meet the needs of its creative customers. Business Organization The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment currently operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data. Hardware Products The Company offers a range of personal computing products including desktop and notebook computers, server and storage products, related devices and peripherals, and various third-party hardware products. The Companys entire line of Macintosh® systems, excluding servers and storage systems, features the Companys Mac OS® X Version 10.4 Tiger and iLife® suite of software for digital photography, music, movies, and music creation. Macintosh® Computers In June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers.

Markets and Distribution The Companys customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and business markets. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and  12    cataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2005, 2004, or 2003. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores in the U.S. and internationally. Over 12% of the Companys net sales in 2005 were through its U.S. education channel, including sales to elementary and secondary schools, higher education institutions, and individual customers. Competition The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The market for personal computers and related software and peripheral products is highly competitive. This market continues to be characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. The principal competitive factors in the market for personal computers include price, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing products. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of innovations from competing platforms. The Companys future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms. The Companys services and products relating to music and other creative content have already encouraged significant competition from other companies, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, and manufacturing resources than those of the Company. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products and distribution services, subscription services, and free peer-to-peer music services. The Company anticipates that competition will intensify as hardware, software, and content providers work more collaboratively to offer integrated products competing with the Companys offerings. However, the Company believes it currently maintains a competitive advantage by more effectively integrating an entire solution, including the hardware (iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of third-party digital content (iTunes Music Store). Raw Materials Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components  13    obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company did experience such delays during 2004 and 2005 related to PowerPC G5 processors, which resulted in the constrained availability of certain products. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. In June 2005, the Company announced its intention to transition its Macintosh computers using the PowerPC G5 and G4 microprocessors, which are currently single-sourced, to Intel microprocessors by the end of calendar year 2007. The announcement of this transition may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services, including PowerPC G5 and G4 microprocessors. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Broadcom Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., IBM Corporation, Intel Corporation, International Display Technology, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, NVIDIA Corp., PortalPlayer, Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Synaptics, Inc., and Toshiba Corporation. Research and Development Because the personal computer and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, consumer electronic products, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Companys research and development expenditures totaled $534 million, $489 million, and $471 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPods, peripherals and software. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for Apple, the Apple logo, Macintosh, iPod, iTunes, iTunes Music Store, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the  14    ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third-parties. Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data The U.S. represents the Companys largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 60% of the Companys net sales in 2005 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Companys manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Companys products and final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and iPods are performed by third-party vendors in China. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data. Seasonal Business The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys future net sales or financial performance. Warranty The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most of the Companys hardware products in all of its major markets. Backlog In the Companys experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 15    Environmental Laws Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member states, Japan, and California. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Employees As of September 24, 2005, the Company had approximately 14,800 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,020 temporary employees and contractors. Available Information The Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available on its website at http://www.apple.com/investor when such reports are available on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website.

The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, the Companys references to the URLs for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only. Item 2. Properties The Companys headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. The Company has manufacturing facilities in Cork, Ireland. As of September 24, 2005, the Company leased approximately 3.6 million square feet of space, primarily in the U.S., and to a lesser extent, in Europe, Japan, Canada, and the Asia Pacific region. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leased space includes approximately 902,000 square feet of retail space, a majority of which is in the U.S. Lease terms for retail space range from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. The Company owns a 352,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland that also houses a customer support call center. The Company also owns a 752,000 square-foot facility in Sacramento, California that houses warehousing and distribution operations as well as a customer support call center. In addition, the Company owns approximately 942,000 square feet of facilities located in Cupertino, California, used for research and development and corporate functions. Outside the U.S., the Company owns additional facilities totaling approximately 169,000 square feet. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment are well maintained and in good operating condition. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors, and therefore believes it has adequate manufacturing capacity for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products. 16     Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed below. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during 2005 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Advanced Audio Devices LLC v. Apple Computer, Inc. Plaintiff Advanced Audio Devices (AAD) filed this action on March 3, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, alleging infringement by the Company of U.S. Patent 6,587,403 entitled Music Jukebox. The complaint sought unspecified damages and other relief.

Apple Corps Ltd. Plaintiff Apple Corps filed this action on July 4, 2003 in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, in London alleging that the Company has breached a 1991 agreement that resolved earlier trademark litigation between the parties regarding use of certain Apple marks. Plaintiff seeks an injunction, unspecified damages, and other relief. The Company filed a motion on October 13, 2003, challenging jurisdiction in the U.K. The Court denied this motion on April 7, 2004. The Company filed an appeal of the Courts decision but subsequently withdrew the appeal. In November 2004, Plaintiff served the Company with an Amended Bill of Particulars and on December 23, 2004 the Company filed a Defence. Plaintiff has indicated its intention to file a Re-Amended Bill of Particulars. The Companys Defence to the Re-Amended Bill of Particulars is not yet due. Trial is set for the week of March 27, 2006. On October 8, 2003, the Company filed a lawsuit against Apple Corps in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California requesting a declaratory judgment that the Company has not breached the 1991 agreement. Apple Corps challenged jurisdiction in the California case but the Court denied that challenge on March 25, 2004. Apple Corps subsequently prevailed on a motion to stay the California case during the pendency of the U.K. action. The Company has dismissed the California lawsuit without prejudice. Bader v. Anderson; Bader v. Apple Computer, Inc. et. al. Plaintiff filed this purported shareholder derivative action against the Company and each of its current executive officers and members of its Board of Directors on May 19, 2005 in Santa Clara County Superior Court asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, material misstatements and omissions, and violations of California Businesses and Professions Code §17200 (unfair competition). Plaintiff alleges that the Companys March 14, 2005 proxy statement was false and misleading for failure to disclose certain information relating to the Apple Computer, Inc. Performance Bonus Plan which was approved by shareholders at the annual meeting held on April 21, 2005. Plaintiff, who ostensibly brings suit on the Companys behalf, has made no demand on the Board of Directors and alleges that such demand is excused. Plaintiff seeks injunctive and other relief for purported injury to the Company. On July 27, 2005, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging that, in addition to the purported derivative claims, adoption of the bonus plan and distribution of the proxy statement describing that plan also inflicted injury on her  17    directly as an individual shareholder. Defendants filed a demurrer which is scheduled to be heard on December 6, 2005. Baghdasarian, et al. v. Apple Computer, Inc. Plaintiffs filed this action in Los Angeles County Superior Court on October 31, 2005, on behalf of a purported nationwide class of all purchasers of all Apple wireless products (router, modem, or adaptor) sold at any time. The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the transmission rates of these products. The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of express warranty and for violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Business & Professions Code §17200 (unfair competition) and California Business & Professions Code §17500 (false advertising). The complaint seeks damages and equitable remedies. The Companys response to the complaint is not yet due. Branning et al. v. Apple Computer, Inc.

The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes that providing a  27    high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 124 stores open as of September 24, 2005. The Company also staffs selected third-party stores with the Companys own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and contractors in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world. To improve access to the iPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels listed above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 28    The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to the relevant program. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer and consumer electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded. 29    The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. Warranty Costs The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Companys results of operations. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which, if implemented by the Company, would affect the Companys tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position. 30     Net Sales Net sales and Macintosh unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product follow (net sales in millions and unit sales in thousands):             September 24,   2005       Change       September 25,   2004       Change       September 27,   2003         Net Sales by Operating Segment:                                                                                         Americas net sales           $   6,590               64   %           $   4,019               26   %           $   3,181             Europe net sales           3,073               71   %           1,799               37   %           1,309             Japan net sales           920               36   %           677               (3   )%           698             Retail net sales           2,350               98   %           1,185               91   %           621             Other Segments net sales (a)           998               67   %           599               51   %           398             Total net sales           $   13,931               68   %           $   8,279               33   %           $   6,207             Unit   Sales by Operating Segment:                                                                                         Americas Macintosh unit sales           2,184               30   %           1,682               4   %           1,620             Europe Macintosh unit sales           1,138               47   %           773               13   %           684             Japan Macintosh unit sales           313               8   %           291               (14   )%           339             Retail Macintosh unit sales           609               94   %           314               68   %           187             Other Segments Macintosh unit sales (a)           290               26   %           230               26   %           182             Total Macintosh unit sales           4,534               38   %           3,290               9   %           3,012             Net   Sales by Product:                                                                                         Desktops (b)           $   3,436               45   %           $   2,373               (4   )%           $   2,475             Portables (c)           2,839               11   %           2,550               26   %           2,016             Total Macintosh net sales           6,275               27   %           4,923               10   %           4,491             iPod           4,540               248   %           1,306               279   %           345             Other music related products and services (d)           899               223   %           278               672   %           36             Peripherals and other hardware (e)           1,126               18   %           951               38   %           691             Software, service, and other sales (f)           1,091               33   %           821               27   %           644             Total net sales           $   13,931               68   %           $   8,279               33   %           $   6,207             Unit   Sales by Product:                                                                                         Desktops (b)           2,520               55   %           1,625               (8   )%           1,761             Portables (c)           2,014               21   %           1,665               33   %           1,251             Total Macintosh unit sales           4,534               38   %           3,290               9   %           3,012             Net sales per Macintosh unit sold (g)           $   1,384               (7   )%           $   1,496               0   %           $   1,491             iPod unit sales           22,497               409   %           4,416               370   %           939             Net sales per iPod   unit sold (h)           $   202               (32   )%           $   296               (19   )%           $   367                Notes: (a)     Other Segments include Asia Pacific and FileMaker.

Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2005: ·       Net sales of iPods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 compared to 2004. Unit sales of iPods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represents an increase of 409% from the 4.4 million iPod units sold in 2004. Strong sales of iPods during 2005 continued to be experienced in all of the Companys operating segments and was driven by strong demand for the iPod shuffle introduced in January 2005, the release of an updated version of the iPod mini in February 2005, the release of the iPod nano in September 2005, and expansion of the iPods distribution network. Net sales per iPod unit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower priced iPod shuffle in January 2005 and iPod mini pricing reductions in February 2005. From the introduction of the iPod in 2002 through 2005, the Company has sold approximately 28 million iPods. ·       Other music related products and services consists of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod services and accessories. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or 223% during 2005 compared to 2004. The Company has experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store is primarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the U.S. and expansion in Europe, Canada, and Japan. ·       Total Macintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005 compared to 2004. The increases in Macintosh net sales and unit sales relate primarily to strong demand for the Companys desktop products, which was experienced in all of the Companys operating segments. The Company believes that the success of the iPod is having a positive impact on Macintosh net sales by introducing new customers to the Companys other products. Desktop demand was stimulated in 2005 due to the new iMac G5 and the introduction of the Mac mini in January 2005. Net sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%, respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Macintosh net sales and unit sales also include sales of the Companys portable products, which increased 11% and 21%, respectively, compared to 2004. Net sales per Macintosh unit sold decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was the result of changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced consumer products, specifically the impact of the Mac mini product, and desktop and portable price reductions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of direct sales. ·       The Retail segments net sales grew 98% to $2.4 billion during 2005 compared to 2004. This increase is largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 86 at the end of 2004 to 124 at the end of 2005, as well as 44% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the Companys customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Companys preexisting sales channels in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K., the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance. ·       Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other hardware include AirPort cards and base stations, Xserve RAID storage, iSight digital video cameras, and third-party hardware products. ·       The Companys U.S. education channel experienced year-over-year growth in both net sales and unit sales of approximately 21% for 2005. The increase in U.S. education net sales for 2005 relates  32    primarily to a 32% year-over-year increase in higher education net sales due to increased iMac shipments, portable system shipments, and online sales. The Company also experienced 11% growth in K-12 net sales due to increased iBook sales and education 1:1 sales. While net sales to the K-12 market were slightly higher during 2005 than 2004, the Company believes this market continues to be subject to budget constraints and competitive pressures. ·       Net sales of software, service and other sales rose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. This growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales in AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended service and support contracts, driven primarily by higher associated Macintosh computer sales. Additionally, the Company experienced increases in net sales of .Mac Internet service, professional and consumer applications, third-party software, and Mac OS X that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4 Tiger in April 2005. Fiscal Year 2004 versus 2003 During 2004, net sales increased 33% or $2.1 billion from 2003. Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2004: ·       Net sales of Macintosh systems increased $432 million or 10% during 2004 compared to 2003 while net sales per Macintosh unit sold remained relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 278,000 units or 9% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases in net sales and unit sales were a result of strong demand for all of the Companys Macintosh systems, except the iMac. The Companys portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and iBook, produced the strongest revenue and unit growth during 2004 compared to 2003 of approximately 26% and 33%, respectively. Unit sales of portable systems accounted for 51% of all Macintosh systems sold during 2004 compared to only 42% during 2003. The Company believes that these results reflected an overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. Performance of the Companys Power Macintosh systems also yielded positive results in 2004 over 2003, including a 15% and 6% increase in net sales and unit sales, respectively. The increase in Power Macintosh sales in 2004 was due primarily to the introduction of the Power Mac G5, which began shipping at the end of 2003. Although Power Macintosh sales increased from 2003, sales of this product were constrained in the second half of 2004 as a result of manufacturing problems at IBM, the Companys sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor. ·       Net sales of iPods rose $961 million or 279% during 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales of iPods totaled 4.4 million in 2004, which represents an increase of 370% from the 939,000 iPod units sold in 2003. Strong demand for the iPods during 2004 were experienced in all of the Companys operating segments and was driven by enhancements to the iPod, the introduction of the iPod mini, increased expansion of the Companys iPod distribution network, and continued success of the iTunes Music Store due largely to making it available to both Macintosh and Windows users in the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany. ·       The Retail segments net sales grew 91% to $1.2 billion during 2004 compared to 2003. This increase was largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 65 at the end of 2003 to 86 at the end of 2004, as well as a 36% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the Companys customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may have elected to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Companys preexisting sales channels in the U.S. and Japan, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance. ·       Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 38% during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other  33    computer accessories include AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital video cameras, and third-party hardware products. The increase in total net sales of peripherals and other hardware was related to the overall increase in Macintosh unit sales and the introduction of new and updated peripheral products and was experienced predominantly by the Companys Americas, Europe, and Retail segments. ·       Net sales of other music related products and services increased $242 million or 672% during 2004 compared to 2003. The Company experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for 2004. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store, which was originally introduced in April 2003, was primarily due to making the service available for Windows in October 2003 and the introduction of the service in the U.K., France, and Germany in June 2004. ·       Net sales of software rose $140 million or 39% during 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to higher net sales of the Companys Apple-branded software and in particular, higher net sales of the Companys operating system software, including Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther, which was released in October 2003. Net sales of Panther accounted for approximately $74 million or over 50% of the increase in software net sales for 2004 compared to 2003. ·       The Companys U.S. education channel experienced year-over-year growth in net sales of approximately 19% for 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales also increased by 10% during 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in U.S. education net sales for 2004 related primarily to a 40% year-over-year increase in higher education net sales and to a lesser extent the Companys 3% growth in K-12 net sales. ·       Service and other sales increased $37 million or 13% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases were the result of significant year-over-year increases in net sales associated with APP extended maintenance and support services, as well as increased net sales associated with the Companys .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales associated with APP were primarily the result of higher Macintosh unit sales and higher attach rates on APP over the last several years. Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during 2004 were negatively impacted by the following: ·       Net sales and unit sales of iMac systems were down 23% and 16%, respectively, during 2004 versus 2003. The decrease in iMac net sales and unit sales was largely due to the delay in the introduction of the new iMac, based on the PowerPC G5 processor, primarily as a result of manufacturing problems experienced by IBM. The delays in the new iMac resulted in the depletion of inventory of the old iMac flat panel prior to availability of the new iMac G5. The old flat panel iMac form factor, which was available during most of 2004, was nearly 3 years old by the time the new iMac G5 began shipping in September 2004 and had experienced declines in sales as a result of the age of this product. The Company believes that sales of iMac systems have also declined due to a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and desktop models from competitors with price points below $1,000. ·       Net sales and unit sales in the Companys Japan segment decreased 3% and 14%, respectively, during 2004 versus 2003. The Company believes these declines related to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the Tokyo and Osaka store openings in 2004. Declines in net sales in Japan may have also related to delays in computer upgrades by certain professional and creative customers pending release in Japan of certain Mac OS X native applications, such as Quark Xpress 6, which did not become available until September 2004. When sales from the Japan retail stores are included in the results for the Japan segment, the combined revenue in Japan resulted in a 3% year-over-year increase in 2004 as compared to 2003. See  34    additional comments below related to the Japan segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operated Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. during 2005. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data. Americas During 2005, net sales in the Americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. The increase in net sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod sales, sales of other music related products and services, and strong sales of desktop and portable Macintosh systems. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 117 stores in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of 2005. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily by strong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the new iMac, which began shipping in September 2004, and the Mac mini, which was introduced in January 2005. During 2005 and 2004, the Americas segment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. As noted above, the Company experienced an increase in both U.S. education channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004. Strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong iMac shipments, portable system shipments, and online sales. This strength drove year-over-year growth in net sales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. Despite challenges in the K-12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive pressures, the Companys K-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 11% during 2005 due to increased iBook sales and 1:1 education sales. During 2004, net sales in the Americas segment grew 26% or $838 million compared to 2003. The increase in net sales during 2004 was primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod sales as well as strong sales of peripherals, software, and services. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 84 stores in the U.S. as of the end of 2004. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 4% in 2004 compared to 2003, driven primarily by strong sales of portable and Power Macintosh systems, partially offset by weakness in iMac sales. During 2004 and 2003, the Americas segment represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales and represented approximately 51% and 54%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The Company experienced an increase in U.S. education channel net sales of 19% for 2004 compared to 2003. Strong U.S. education net sales for 2004 related primarily to strength in higher education net sales that resulted from a successful back-to-school selling season with strong demand for the Companys portables. This strength drove year-over-year growth in net sales of 40% for the higher education channel during 2004. The Companys K-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 3% during 2004, despite the challenges in the K-12 market from continued budget constraints and increased competition. Europe During 2005, net sales in the Europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing 47% in 2005 compared to  35    2004. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales of desktop products, iPod, other music related products and services, and software and service sales. Demand in Europe during 2005 was particularly strong for the Companys desktop computers, which experienced a year-over-year increase of 56%. Similar to the results of the Companys other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in 2005. Net sales in Europe rebounded in 2004 increasing $490 million or 37% from 2003. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth in 2004 by increasing 13% compared to 2003. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales across all product lines, except the iMac systems. Demand in Europe during 2004 was particularly strong for the Companys Power Macintosh systems and portable Macintosh systems, which experienced year-over-year increases of 29% and 42%, respectively. Similar to the results of the Companys other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in 2004 over 2003. Japan Japans net sales and Macintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, iPod, and other music related products and services. Desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and iPod sales increased by 220% during 2005 compared to 2004. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, which the Company believes might be attributable to a shift in sales from portables to the new iMac G5 and Mac mini, and a shift to the Retail segment as a result of opening two additional stores in Japan during 2005. Japans net sales and Macintosh unit sales were down 3% and 14%, respectively, during 2004 compared to 2003, which lagged behind all of the Companys other operating segments. These decreases in net sales and unit sales were believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in Japan in 2004. In addition, such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of Quark XPress 6 for Mac OS X, which did not occur until September 2004. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong iPod and iBook sales during 2004 compared to 2003. Retail The Company opened 38 new retail stores during 2005, including 6 international stores in the U.K, Japan, and Canada, bringing the total number of open stores to 124 as of September 24, 2005. This compares to 86 open stores as of September 25, 2004 and 65 open stores as of September 27, 2003. Net sales of the Retail segment grew to $2.4 billion during 2005 from $1.2 billion and $621 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases in net sales during both 2005 and 2004 reflect the impact of new store openings for each year, including the opening of 38 new stores in 2005 and 21 new stores in 2004. An increase in average revenue per store also contributed to the segments strong sales in 2005. With an average of 105 stores open during 2005, the Retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $22.4 million, as compared to $15.6 million in 2004 with a 76 store average, and $11.5 million in 2003 with a 54 store average. As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $151 million during 2005 as compared to operating income of $39 million during 2004 and an operating loss of $5 million during 2003. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segments year-over-year increase in average revenue per store, the impact of opening new stores, and the segments year-over-year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs. 36    Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment were $132 million in 2005, bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the Retail segment to approximately $529 million. As of September 24, 2005, the Retail segment had approximately 3,673 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $606 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Gross Margin Gross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):             September 24,   2005       September 25,   2004       September 27,   2003         Net sales           $   13,931               $   8,279               $   6,207             Cost of sales           9,888               6,020               4,499             Gross margin           $   4,043               $   2,259               $   1,708             Gross margin percentage           29.0   %           27.3   %           27.5   %           Gross margin increased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. The Companys gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including LCD flat-panel displays and DRAM memory; an increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct sales related primarily to the Companys Retail and online stores; and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. These increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales. The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure in light of price competition, especially for the iPod product line. The Company expects gross margin percentage to decline in the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as the iPod and content from the iTunes Music Store. The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin are forward-looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products, including iPods, will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Companys product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. 37     The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Companys operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. Gross margin declined in 2004 to 27.3% of net sales from 27.5% of net sales in 2003. The Companys gross margin during 2004 declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin iPod and iBook sales, pricing actions on certain Power Macintosh G5 models that were transitioned during the beginning of 2004, higher warranty costs on certain portable Macintosh products, and higher freight and duty costs during 2004. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a 39% year-over-year increase in higher margin software sales. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except for percentages):             September 24,       September 25,       September 27,                 2005       2004       2003         Research and   development           $   534               $   489               $   471             Percentage of net sales           4   %           6   %           8   %         Selling, general,   and administrative expenses           $   1,859               $   1,421               $   1,212             Percentage of net sales           13   %           17   %           20   %         Restructuring costs           $                  $   23               $   26               Research and Development (R&D) The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&D expense amounted to approximately 4% of total net sales during 2005 down from 6% and 8% of total net sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. This decrease is due to the significant increase of 68% in total net sales of the Company for 2005. Although R&D expense decreased as a percentage of total net sales in 2005, actual expense for R&D in 2005 increased $45 million or 9% from 2004, which follows an $18 million or 4% increase in 2004 compared to 2003. The overall increase in R&D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities and the impact of employee salary increases in 2005. R&D expense does not include capitalized software development costs of approximately $29.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Tiger during 2005; $4.5 million related to the development of Mac OS X Tiger and $2.3 million related to the development of FileMaker Pro 7 in 2004; and $14.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Panther in 2003. Further information related to the Companys capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A) Expenditures for SG&A increased $438 million or 31% during 2005 compared to 2004. These increases are due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary  38    merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2005 was 13%, down from 17% in 2004, which is due to the increase in total net sales of 68% for the Company during 2005. Expenditures for SG&A increased $209 million or 17% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases were due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, an increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, an increase in amortization costs associated with restricted stock compensation, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2004 was 17%, down from 20% in 2003 due to the increase in total net sales for the Company of 33% during 2004. Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during 2004, including approximately $14 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations in conjunction with the vacating of a leased sales facility in Europe during the fourth quarter of 2004 related to a European workforce reduction. Of the $23 million charge, $19.7 million had been utilized by the end of 2005, with the remaining $3.3 million consisting of $0.7 million for employee severance benefits and $2.6 million for lease cancellations. These actions will result in the termination of 461 employees, 448 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2005. Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments, and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations primarily related to the closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations during the first quarter of 2003. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been utilized by the end of 2005, except for approximately $1.7 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. These actions resulted in the termination of 353 employees. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions):             September 24,       September 25,       September 27,                 2005       2004       2003         Gains on   non-current investments, net           $                  $   4               $   10             Interest income           $   183               $   64               $   69             Interest expense                          (3   )           (8   )         Gains on sales of   short term investments, net                          1               21             Other income   (expense), net           (18   )           (9   )           1             Interest and   Other Income, net           $   165               $   53               $   83             Total other   income and expense           $   165               $   57               $   93               Gains and Losses on Non-current Investments The Company previously held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). The Company sold all of the remaining holdings in these non-current investments in 2004 and 2003. Pretax gains recorded upon the sale of these non-current investments were $4 million and $10 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. 39    Interest and Other Income, Net Total interest and other income, net increased $112 million or 211% to $165 million during 2005 compared to $53 million in 2004 and $83 million in 2003. These increases are attributable primarily to increasing investment yields on the Companys cash and short-term investments and higher invested balances. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to 2.70% in 2005 compared to the 1.38% and 1.89% rates earned during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net losses of $137,000 in 2005 and net gains of $1 million and $21 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase in other income were higher foreign currency hedging expenses. Interest expense consisted primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004. The unsecured notes were sold at 99.925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes maturity in February 2004. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate for the year ended September 24, 2005 was approximately 26%. The Companys effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., research and development tax credits, and a reduction of certain tax contingency reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets. The benefit from adjustments to tax contingency reserves and net deferred tax assets was $67 million. In addition, the Company recorded a $25 million reduction of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that, in managements opinion, are now more likely than not to be realized in the future. $14 million of the valuation allowance reduction was recorded as a credit to income tax expense, and the remainder was recorded as a credit to goodwill. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $767 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Companys balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $5 million and $30 million, respectively, was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax loss carryforwards that may not be realized. The remaining valuation allowance at September 24, 2005 relates principally to certain state operating loss carryforwards. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2002 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the  40    AJCA. The legislation provided the Company with the option to apply this provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either 2005 or 2006. The Company is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision and expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. A maximum of $755 million may be eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate provided by AJCA. However, given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the Companys continuing evaluation, the Company has not yet determined the amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 amend SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, SFAS No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations, as well as APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. This guidance nullifies certain requirements of EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 include guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 also require other-than-temporary impaired debt securities to be written down to its impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis. FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. SFAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 151, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109-2 provides additional time to companies beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on their plans for repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of AJCA, which if implemented by the Company would affect the Companys tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities. However, given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the Companys continuing evaluation, it is not possible at this time to determine the amount, if any, that will be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation. The Company expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment, that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such  41    equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and instead requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense on all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately $0.03 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, to clarify the requirement to record liabilities stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event. The Company plans to adopt FIN 47 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and does not expect the application of FIN 47 to have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial StatementsAn Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 154, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions):             September 24,       September 25,       September 27,                 2005       2004       2003         Cash, cash   equivalents, and short-term investments           $   8,261               $   5,464               $   4,566             Accounts   receivable, net           $   895               $   774               $   766             Inventory           $   165               $   101               $   56             Working capital           $   6,816               $   4,404               $   3,530             Days sales in   accounts receivable (DSO) (a)           22               30               41             Days of supply in   inventory (b)           6               5               4             Days payables   outstanding (DPO) (c)           62               76               82             Annual operating cash   flow           $   2,535               $   934               $   289                (a)          DSO is based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b)         Days supply of inventory is based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. (c)          DPO is based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales adjusted for the change in inventory. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had $8.261 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $2.797 billion over the same balances at the end of 2004. The principal components of this increase were ­cash generated by operating activities of $2.535 billion and proceeds of $543 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, partially offset by cash used to  42    purchase property, plant, and equipment of $260 million. The Companys short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid investments. As of September 24, 2005, approximately $4.3 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the one-time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate earnings from some of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Capital Expenditures The Companys total capital expenditures were $260 million during 2005, $132 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment and $128 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $390 million for capital expenditures during 2006, approximately $210 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. Stock Repurchase Plan In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock during 2005 or 2004. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 24, 2005. On February 28, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. 43    The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 24, 2005 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Companys balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions):             Total       Payments   Due in Less   Than   1 year       Payments   Due in   1-3 years       Payments   Due in   4-5 years       Payments   Due in More   Than   5 years         Operating Leases       $   865           $   108               $   211               $   192               $   354             Purchase   Obligations       1,994           1,994                                                          Asset Retirement   Obligations       14                          2               2               10             Other Obligations       4           4                                                          Total       $   2,877           $   2,106               $   213               $   194               $   364               Lease Commitments As of September 24, 2005, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $865 million, $606 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Lease terms on the Companys existing major facility operating leases range from 5 to 20 years. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $2.0 billion. Subsequent to September 24, 2005, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion for flash memory components by the end of the second quarter of 2006. Asset Retirement Obligations The Companys asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 24, 2005, the Company estimates that gross expected future cash flows of approximately $14 million will be required to fulfill these obligations. Other Obligations The Companys other obligations of approximately $4 million are primarily related to Internet and telecommunications services. Indemnifications The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company  44    could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Companys products and the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. The Companys operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. At times in the past, demand for the Companys products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Companys education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding. Although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery, continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the Companys products and related operating results. Should global and/or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Companys products could be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. War, terrorism, public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect the Companys operations and performance. War, terrorism, public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Companys suppliers or customers. The Companys major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by these events. 45    The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected. The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for personal computing products. The Companys results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Companys key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Companys competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Companys products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Companys markets. The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating systems, including Windows and Linux. The Companys future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. Additionally, if unauthorized copies of the Mac OS are used on other companies hardware products and result in decreased demand for the Companys hardware products, the Companys results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products, including music enabled cell phones, distribution services, and free peer-to-peer music services. These competitors include both new entrants with different market approaches, such as subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have greater technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than those of the Company, as well as established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Companys operating results and financial position. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the U.S. The Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and/or increasing features which could adversely affect the Companys music product gross margins as well as overall Company gross margins. 46    The Company also faces increased competition in the U.S. education market. U.S. elementary and secondary schools, as well as college and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. Uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers, which could negatively affect the Companys market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. 1:1 learning solutions typically consist of iBook portable systems for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. These 1:1 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results and financial condition. The Companys transition from PowerPC microprocessors used by Macintosh computers to microprocessors built by Intel is subject to numerous risks. In June 2005, the Company announced its intention to transition from the use of PowerPC microprocessors to the use of Intel microprocessors in all of its Macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007. This transition is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the Companys ability to timely develop and deliver new products using Intel microprocessors, the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware and software products, including the Companys applications, to support Intel microprocessors, market acceptance of Intel-based Macintosh computers, the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to timely deliver Intel-based Macintosh computers, and the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand for both PowerPC and Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company is dependent on third-party software developers such as Microsoft and Adobe continuing to support current applications that run on PowerPC-based computers and timely developing versions of current and future applications that run on Intel and PowerPC-based Macintosh computers. The Companys inability to timely deliver new Intel-based products or obtain developer commitment both to continue supporting applications that run on PowerPC microprocessors and timely transition their applications to run natively on Intel-based products may have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. The Companys announcement of its intention to transition to Intel microprocessors may negatively impact sales of current and future Macintosh products containing PowerPC microprocessors, as customers may elect to delay purchases until the Intel-based products are available. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its historical gross margin percentages on its products, including Intel-based Macintosh computers, which may adversely impact the Companys results of operations. Future operating results are dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources. Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, NAND flash-memory, and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have  47    experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Companys requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Companys ability to produce and market competitive products is dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (Freescale) to supply PowerPC microprocessors and Intel to supply its microprocessors for the Companys Macintosh computers and to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors. While the Company has supply agreements with IBM and Freescale, the Companys recent announcement of plans to transition to Intel microprocessors may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services, including PowerPC G4 and G5 microprocessors, which are essential to the Companys business and are currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources. Additionally, there have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition, IBM is currently the Companys sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor, which is used in the Companys current Power Mac, Xserve, and iMac G5 products. Freescale is the sole supplier of the G4 processor, which is used in the Companys eMac, Mac mini, and portable products. IBM experienced manufacturing problems with the PowerPC G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. Manufacturing problems experienced by any of the Companys suppliers in the future or failure by them to deliver components to the Company in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Companys existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, and production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, including anticipated demand for PowerPC-based and Intel-based Macintosh computers; the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. The Companys products from time to time experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits. The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third-parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells.  48    Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy. Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are currently adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, and because of the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S. Most of the Companys products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Companys future operating results and financial condition. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently performed in the Companys manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacturing of many of the components used in the Companys products is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and iPods is performed by third-party vendors in China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, as well as information technology system failures or military actions, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 49     The Companys future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Companys products. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Companys resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by weak economic conditions over the last several years. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment. Over the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Companys net sales has been made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Some of the Companys resellers have perceived this expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Companys products. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Companys products. Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading Markets and Distribution. The Company relies on third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with third parties to offer their digital content to customers through the Companys iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third-party digital content. The Companys licensing arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed alliances, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer digital content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. Further, some third-party content providers currently, or may in the future, offer music products and services that compete with the Companys music products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their digital content in the future. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the Companys iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected. Third-party content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license  50    such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial position. The Companys future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Companys hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Companys products. The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Companys hardware products depends in part on third-party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Companys products versus software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. This analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market has caused software developers to question the Companys prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all. In June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers. The Company plans to begin shipping certain models with Intel microprocessors by June 2006 and to complete this transition to Intel microprocessors for all of its Macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007. The Company depends on third-party software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run on Intel and PowerPC microprocessors. The Companys inability to timely deliver new Intel-based products, or a decline in available applications that run on the Companys PowerPC products or the lack of applications that run on Intel-based Macintosh systems could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial position. In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers, such as Microsoft and Adobe, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the decisions of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, professional digital photo editing and workflow management, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database management, word processing, and high-quality presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application. Discontinuance of third-party products for the Macintosh platform, including Microsoft Office could have an adverse effect on the Companys net sales and results of operations. 51    The Companys business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Companys future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. Because of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time-consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Companys future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Companys retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Through October 2005, the Company had opened 126 retail stores. The Companys retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a significant decline in sales for any reason. Certain of the Companys stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has opened seven such stores through October 2005. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total  52    remaining commitments per location ranging from $4 million to $46 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Many of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Companys control, that could adversely affect the Retail segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has and may in the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the Companys strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of managements attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence process. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Companys business, operating results or financial condition. Declines in the sales of the Companys professional products, software, accessories, or service and support contracts, or increases in sales of consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Companys professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems, software, accessories, and service and support contracts, generally have higher gross margins than the Companys consumer products, including iMacs, iBooks, iPods, and content from the iTunes Music Store. A shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the Companys future gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Companys traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac G5 and iBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy the iMac G5 due to its relative price performance, use of the same PowerPC G5 processor used in the Companys Power Macs, and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. Potential PowerBook customers may also choose to purchase iBooks instead due to their price performance and screen size. Additionally, significant future growth in iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages. It is likely that some of the Companys current and potential professional, creative, and small business customers, who are most likely to utilize professional systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance. These factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the Companys professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages. 53    The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. The Companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Companys direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. Additionally, the Companys direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products, which generally have higher gross margins, than its indirect channels. As a result, the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic, or channel mix, or new product announcements, including the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Companys internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Companys ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors. The Companys ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Companys brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has entered into long-term supply agreements to secure supply of NAND flash-memory and intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion under these agreements. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. The Companys success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of  54    the Companys key employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Recent accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options will impair the Companys future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel. The Company is subject to risks associated with the selection, availability, and cost of insurance. The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance. Such conditions have and may continue to result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial position. Failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Companys ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the Company or a third-party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations. A large portion of the Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can cause the Company to modify international pricing and affect the value of the Companys foreign denominated sales, and in some cases, may also increase the cost to the Company of some product components. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. 55    Further information related to the Companys global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading Foreign Currency Risk and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan, and certain states within the U.S. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. Changes in accounting rules could affect the Companys future operating results. Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards. A change from current accounting standards could have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for share-based payments, SFAS No. 123R. In April 2005, the SEC deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 123R to years beginning after June 15, 2005. Therefore, SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately $0.03 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Although the effect from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair-value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stock-based compensation expense. Changes in the Companys tax rates could affect its future results. The Companys future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse affect on the Companys net income and financial condition. The Companys stock price may be volatile. The Companys stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive general economic and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Companys stock in the future. In addition, increases in the Companys stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share. 56     Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial position. Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Companys short-term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 24, 2005, approximately $287 million of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 25, 2004, $180 million of the Companys investment portfolio classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities, due to liquidity needs, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized a net loss before taxes of $137,000 in 2005, and net gains before taxes of $1 million and $21 million in 2004, and 2003, respectively as a result of such sales. In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2005, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $19.9 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 25, 2004, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $14.4 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Companys policy is to hold investments to maturity. 57    From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during 2005 or 2004 and had no open interest rate derivatives at September 24, 2005. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $10.0 million as of September 24, 2005 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $3.2 million as of September 25, 2004. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2005 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Companys actual exposures and positions. 58     Item 8.

STATEMENTS Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Apple Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and television shows. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition to its own hardware, software, and peripheral products, the Company sells a variety of third-party hardware and software products through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Typically, the Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The Company will add this additional week in the first fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2006. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. Common Stock Split On February 28, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Financial Instruments Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates available-for-sale designation as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the 64    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. For such contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $141 million, $126 million, and $108 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. 65    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Asset Retirement Obligations The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Companys existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The following table reconciles changes in the Companys asset retirement liabilities for fiscal 2004 and 2005 (in millions):     Asset retirement   liability as of September 27, 2003       $   7.2         Additional asset retirement obligations recognized       0.5         Accretion recognized       0.5         Asset retirement liability as of September 25,   2004       $   8.2         Additional asset retirement obligations recognized       2.8         Accretion recognized       0.7         Asset retirement   liability as of September 24, 2005       $   11.7           Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes In 2003, the Company recognized a net favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $1 million from the adoption of SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristic of Both Liabilities and Equity and SFAS No. 143. Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three fiscal years ended September 24, 2005, the Company had no material impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests on or about August 30 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2005, 2004, or 2003. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for  66    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Foreign Currency Translation The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. The Companys foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Companys results of operations. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Companys one-year limited warranty. The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at the gross amount billed. 67    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria for that element has been met. Fair value is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Companys software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Companys customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay. Shipping Costs The Companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented. Warranty Expense The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. Software Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers  68    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) pursuant to SFAS No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company began incurring substantial development costs associated with Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004 and the subsequent release of a developer beta version of the product. The Company capitalized approximately $29.7 and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Tiger. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in April 2005 when the Company began shipping Tiger and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the product in March 2004. Therefore, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in March 2004 when the Company began shipping FileMaker Pro 7 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life. During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named Panther), subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $15.7 million, $10.7 million, and $5.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $287 million, $206 million, and $193 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 69    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) As required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options vesting period and the shares plan period. The Companys pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):             2005       2004       2003         Net incomeas reported       $   1,335       $   276       $   69         Add: Stock-based   employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of tax       38       33       15         Deduct: Stock-based   employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method   for all awards, net of tax       (114   )   (141   )   (181   )     Net income (loss)pro   forma       $   1,259       $   168       $   (97   )     Net income per common   shareas reported                                 Basic       $   1.65       $   0.37       $   0.10         Diluted       $   1.56       $   0.36       $   0.09         Net income (loss) per   common sharepro forma                                 Basic       $   1.56       $   0.23       $   (0.13   )     Diluted       $   1.47       $   0.22       $   (0.13   )       In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment, which addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Companys assessment of the estimated stock-based compensation expense is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables and the related tax impact. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Companys stock price, volatility, and employee stock option exercise behaviors and the related tax impact. The Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense on all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method. Although the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair-value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to whether future stock-based compensation expense will be similar to the historical SFAS No. 123 pro forma expense. 70    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:             2005       2004       2003         Numerator (in millions):                                 Income before accounting   changes       $   1,335       $   276       $   68         Cumulative effects of   accounting changes, net of tax                     1         Net income       $   1,335       $   276       $   69         Denominator (in   thousands):                                 Weighted-average shares   outstanding, excluding unvested restricted stock       808,439       743,180       721,262         Effect of dilutive   options, restricted stock units and restricted stock       48,341       31,442       5,670         Denominator for diluted   earnings per share       856,780       774,622       726,932         Basic earnings per share   before accounting changes       $   1.65       $   0.37       $   0.09         Basic earnings per share   after accounting changes       $   1.65       $   0.37       $   0.10         Diluted earnings per   share before accounting changes       $   1.56       $   0.36       $   0.09         Diluted earnings per share after accounting changes       $   1.56       $   0.36       $   0.09           Potentially dilutive securities representing approximately 12.4 million, 8.7 million, and 101.6 million shares of common stock for the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. These potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 71     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Segment Information The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments.

Note 2Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of those instruments. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments The following table summarizes the fair value of the Companys cash and available-for-sale securities held in its short-term investment portfolio, recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments (in millions):             September 24,   2005       September 25,   2004         Cash           $   127               $   200             U.S. Treasury and   Agency securities           89               87             U.S. corporate   securities           2,030               1,795             Foreign   securities           1,245               887             Total cash equivalents           3,364               2,769             U.S. Treasury and Agency securities           216               1,080             U.S. corporate   securities           3,662               1,352             Foreign   securities           892               63             Total short-term investments           4,770               2,495             Total cash, cash   equivalents, and short-term investments           $   8,261               $   5,464               The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses totaling $5.9 million on its investment portfolio, approximately half of which related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year as of September 24, 2005 and net unrealized losses of $6.3 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year as of September 25, 2004. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. The Company recognized a net loss before taxes of $137,000 in 2005 and net gains before taxes of $1 million and $21 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a result of such sales. These net gains were included in interest and other income, net. As of September 24, 2005, approximately $287 million of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 24, 2005 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 25, 2004, approximately $180 million of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 25, 2004 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. 72    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2Financial Instruments (Continued) In accordance with EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, the following table shows gross unrealized losses and fair value for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):             2005                 Less than 12   Months       12 Months or   Greater       Total         Security Description       Fair   Value       Unrealized   Loss       Fair   Value       Unrealized   Loss       Fair   Value       Unrealized   Loss         U.S. Treasury and   Agencies       $   160           $   (1   )           $   2               $              $   162           $   (1   )         Corporate bonds       468             (3   )           26                          494           (3   )         Certificate of deposits       288                                                    288                        Asset backed   securities       60             (1   )                                     60           (1   )         Commercial paper       4,526             (1   )                                     4,526           (1   )         Total       $   5,502           $   (6   )           $   28               $              $   5,530           $   (6   )                       2004                 Less than 12   Months       12 Months or   Greater       Total         Security Description       Fair   Value       Unrealized   Loss       Fair   Value       Unrealized   Loss       Fair   Value       Unrealized   Loss         U.S. Treasury and   Agencies       $   1,126           $   (4   )       $              $              $   1,126           $   (4   )         Corporate bonds       134                      144           (1   )       278           (1   )         Certificate of   deposits       420           (1   )                             420           (1   )         Asset backed   securities       426                                            426                        Commercial paper       2,407           (1   )                             2,407           (1   )         Total       $   4,513           $   (6   )       $   144           $   (1   )       $   4,657           $   (7   )           Market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The decline in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in interest rates and is considered to be temporary in nature. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that 73    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2Financial Instruments (Continued) are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. No customer accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 24, 2005 or September 25, 2004. The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in millions):             September 24,   2005       September 25,   2004       September 27,   2003         Beginning   allowance balance           $   47               $   49               $   51             Charged to costs   and expenses           8               3               4             Deductions (a)           (9   )           (5   )           (6   )         Ending allowance balance           $   46               $   47               $   49                (a)          Represents amounts written off against the allowance, net of recoveries. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $417 million and $276 million as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, respectively. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. 74    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2Financial Instruments (Continued) The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign currency instruments as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004 (in millions):             September 24, 2005       September 25, 2004                 Notional   Principal       Fair   Value       Credit Risk   Amounts       Notional   Principal       Fair   Value       Credit Risk   Amounts         Foreign exchange   instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:                                                                                                         Spot/Forward contracts           $   662               $   10               $   10               $   598               $   (3   )           $   3             Purchased options           $   1,668               $   17               $   17               $   482               $   4               $   4             Sold options           $   1,087               $   (5   )           $                  $   521               $   (3   )           $                Foreign exchange   instruments other than accounting hedges:                                                                                                         Spot/Forward contracts           $   833               $   (3   )           $   1               $   609               $   3               $   4             Purchased options           $   115               $                  $                  $                  $                  $                Sold options           $                  $                  $                  $                  $                  $                  The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. Foreign Exchange Risk Management The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the Companys non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same 75    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2Financial Instruments (Continued) period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 6 months. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company recognized net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Companys forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $3.6 million, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, the Company had a net gain of $673,000 and a net loss of $1.8 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment. The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense. Interest Rate Risk Management From time to time, the Company historically entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on any outstanding long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. During 2001 and 2002, the Company entered into and then subsequently terminated various interest rate debt swap agreements generating a realized gain of $23 million. These gains were deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the underlying debt, which matured and was repaid in February 2004. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. 76     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2Financial Instruments (Continued) Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses The Company previously held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). The Company sold all of the remaining holdings in these non-current investments in 2004 and 2003.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, these NOLs were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized and accordingly the valuation allowances were reversed against the related goodwill that was recognized at the time of the acquisitions. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an adjustment of approximately $5 million to goodwill related to the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool) in 2001. This reduction of goodwill included the cancellation of 158,334 shares of the Companys common stock, valued at approximately $2 million, that were previously held in escrow and were refunded upon resolution of certain matters arising out of the acquisition of PowerSchool. This adjustment also included approximately $3 million to adjust the original estimates of the pre-acquisition PowerSchool restructuring liability to actual costs incurred. 78    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 4Goodwill and Other intangible Assets (Continued) Expected annual amortization expense related to acquired technology is as follows (in millions):     Fiscal Years:                 2006       $   10         2007       8         2008       5         2009       1         2010       1         Thereafter       2         Total expected annual   amortization expense       $   27           Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $9 million, $7 million, and $10 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Note 5Restructuring Charges Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during the year ended September 25, 2004, including approximately $14 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations in conjunction with the vacating of a leased sales facility related to a European workforce reduction during the fourth quarter of 2004. Of the $23 million charge, $19.7 million had been utilized by the end of 2005, with the remaining $3.3 million consisting of $0.7 million for employee severance benefits and $2.6 million for lease cancellations. These actions will result in the termination of 461 employees, 448 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2005.

Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been utilized by the end of 2005, except for approximately $1.7 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally expected and a shortfall 79    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 5Restructuring Charges (Continued) of approximately $500,000 was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense. These actions resulted in the termination of 353 employees.

As of September 24, 2005, approximately $4.3 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Companys consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $1.2 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 80    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6Income Taxes (Continued) On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The legislation provided the Company with the option to apply this provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either 2005 or 2006. The Company is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision and expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. A maximum of $755 million may be eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate provided by AJCA. However, given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the Companys continuing evaluation, the Company has not yet determined the amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, the significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):              2005       2004         Deferred tax assets:                         Accrued liabilities and other reserves       $   321       $   195         Tax losses and credits       305       329         Basis of capital assets and investments       96       65         Accounts receivable and inventory reserves       36       32         Other       9       26         Total deferred tax assets       767       647         Less valuation   allowance       5       30         Net deferred tax   assets       762       617         Deferred tax   liabilities:                         Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries       557       413         Total deferred tax liabilities       557       413         Net deferred tax asset       $   205       $   204           As of September 24, 2005, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $62 million, which expire from 2011 through 2024. A portion of these carryforwards was acquired from the Companys previous acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $206 million and which expire between 2010 and 2025. The remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $5 million and $30 million, respectively, was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The remaining valuation allowance relates principally to the state operating losses. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. 81    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6Income Taxes (Continued) A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2005, 2004, and 2003) to income before provision for income taxes, is as follows (in millions):             2005       2004       2003         Computed expected   tax       $   636       $   134       $   32         State taxes, net   of federal effect       (19   )   (5   )   (4   )     Indefinitely   invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries       (98   )   (31   )   (13   )     Nondeductible   executive compensation       11       10       5         Research and   development credit, net       (26   )   (5   )   (7   )     Other items       (24   )   4       11         Provision for   income taxes       $   480       $   107       $   24         Effective tax rate       26   %   28   %   26   %       During 2005, the Company reversed certain tax contingency reserves and recorded a corresponding benefit to income tax expense primarily as a result of a change in the estimated outcome of certain tax disputes. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a benefit to tax expense to adjust its net deferred tax assets as a result of the Companys year-end review of its deferred tax accounts, the impact of which was not material to the current or prior periods results of operations. The total benefit to income tax expense from the reversal of these tax contingency reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets was $67 million. The Company also recorded a $14 million credit to income tax expense resulting from a reduction of the valuation allowance. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2002 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Note 7Shareholders Equity Preferred Stock The Company has 5 million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 82     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 7Shareholders Equity (Continued) Restricted Stock Units During 2005 and 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the grant of 230,000 and 5.03 million restricted stock units, respectively, to members of the Companys senior management team, excluding its CEO. These restricted stock units generally vest over four years either in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant or in equal installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, the restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The Company has recorded $10.3 million and $64.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, in value for these restricted stock units as a component of shareholders equity and is amortizing the amounts on a straight-line basis over the four-year requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock units was based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. CEO Restricted Stock Award On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Steven P. Jobs, its CEO. The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase of 55 million shares of the Companys common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 120,000 shares of the Companys common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Companys Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Companys CEO. The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 10 million shares of the Companys common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from the date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in control of the Company. The Company determined the value of the restricted stock award in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 and has recorded the value as deferred stock compensation as a component of shareholders equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over the 3 year service period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of the award. The 10 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. Stock Repurchase Plan In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 3.1 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $8.32 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Companys common stock had a fair value of $11.41. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 24, 2005. 83    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 7Shareholders Equity (Continued) Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes (in millions):             2005       2004       2003         Unrealized   gains/(losses) on available-for-sale securities           $   (4   )       $   (4   )   $   1         Unrealized   gains/(losses) on derivative investments           4           (4   )   (16   )     Cumulative   foreign currency translation                      (7   )   (20   )     Accumulated other   comprehensive income/(loss)           $              $   (15   )   $   (35   )       The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to available-for-sale securities, net of taxes (in millions):             2005       2004       2003         Change in fair   value of available-for-sale securities           $                  $   (1   )       $   11         Adjustment for   net gains realized and included in net income                          (4   )       (23   )     Change in unrealized   gain/loss on available-for-sale securities           $                  $   (5   )       $   (12   )       The tax effect related to the change in unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities was $4 million and $6 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The tax effect on the reclassification adjustment for net gains/losses included in net income was $1 million and $(8) million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives, net of taxes, held by the Company (in millions):             2005       2004       2003         Changes in fair   value of derivatives           $   7           $   (21   )   $   (24   )     Adjustment for   net gains realized and included in net income           1           33       19         Change in unrealized   gain/loss on derivative instruments           $   8           $   12       $   (5   )       The tax effect related to the changes in fair value of derivatives was $(3) million, $10 million, and $11 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The tax effect related to derivative gains/losses reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income was $(2) million, $(13) million, and $(7) million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. 84    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 8Employee Benefit Plans 2003 Employee Stock Plan The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702.  No new options can be granted from the 1997 Plan. Employee Stock Option Exchange Program On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Companys common stock on the day the new awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day after the exchange options were cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386 shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $11.38 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Companys stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction. 1997 Director Stock Option Plan In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans Certain of the Companys executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter Oppenheimer, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, Dr. Bertrand Serlet, and Dr. Avadis Tevanian, Jr., have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock units. 85    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 8Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2005, 2004, and 2003, adjusted for the February 2005 stock split 2.3 million, 3.9 million, and 4.3 million shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 24, 2005, approximately 3.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. Employee Savings Plan The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($14,000 for calendar year 2005). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees earnings. The Companys matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $28 million, $24 million, and $21 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. 86    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 8Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Stock Option Activity A summary of the Companys stock option activity and related information for the last three fiscal years follows (share amounts are presented in thousands):             Shares       Outstanding Options                 Available       Number of       Weighted Average                 for Grant       Shares       Exercise Price         Balance at   September 28, 2002           13,142               218,860               $   14.09             Restricted Stock   Granted           (10,000   )                                       Options Granted           (8,358   )           8,358               $   8.19             Options Cancelled           96,886               (96,886   )           $   19.80             Options Exercised                          (4,308   )           $   7.02             Plan Shares   Expired           (10   )                                       Balance at September 27, 2003           91,660               126,024               $   9.54             Restricted Stock   Units Granted           (5,030   )                                       Options Granted           (36,394   )           36,394               $   11.48             Options Cancelled           6,010               (6,010   )           $   10.35             Options Exercised                          (45,686   )           $   8.60             Plan Shares   Expired           (32,196   )                                       Balance at September 25, 2004           24,050               110,722               $   10.52             Additional   Options Authorized           49,000                                           Restricted Stock   Units Granted           (460   )                                       Options Granted           (16,214   )           16,214               $   42.52             Options Cancelled           3,844               (3,844   )           $   13.28             Restricted Stock Units   Cancelled           230                                           Options Exercised                          (49,871   )           $   10.05             Plan Shares   Expired           (1,493   )                                       Balance at   September 24, 2005           58,957               73,221               $   17.79               In conjunction with the amendments to the 2003 Plan that were approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 21, 2005, the number of shares available for grant under the 2003 Plan will be reduced by two times the number of restricted shares and restricted stock units granted. This amendment is effective for all grants made after April 21, 2005. 87    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 8Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) The options outstanding as of September 24, 2005 have been segregated into eight ranges for additional disclosure as follows (option amounts are presented in thousands):      As of September 25, 2004, the Company had exercisable options outstanding to purchase 60.0 million shares with a weighted average exercise price of $10.30 per share. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had exercisable options outstanding to purchase 77.5 million shares with a weighted average exercise price of $9.38 per share. The Company had 5.03 million restricted stock units outstanding as of September 24, 2005, which were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the preceding tables. None of these restricted stock units was vested as of September 24, 2005. These restricted stock units have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans. Note 9Stock-Based Compensation The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Employee Stock Option Exchange Program have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees. The cancellation of certain of the Companys CEOs options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123. 88     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 9Stock-Based Compensation (Continued) The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows:             2005       2004       2003         Expected life of   stock options       3.5 - 3.6 years       3.5 years       3.5 - 4 years         Expected life of   stock purchases       6 months       6 months       6 months         Interest ratestock   options       3.13% - 3.88   %   2.33% - 3.15   %   2.14% - 2.45   %     Interest ratestock   purchases       1.67% - 3.30   %   0.96% - 1.67   %   1.10% - 1.77   %     Volatilitystock   options       39% - 40   %   40   %   40% - 63   %     Volatilitystock   purchases       32% - 48   %   32% - 44   %   35% - 44   %     Dividend yields                              Weighted-average   fair value of options granted during the year       $   14.41       $   3.69       $   3.32         Weighted-average fair   value of stock purchases during the year       $   7.55       $   2.78       $   2.12           For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock and the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. Note 10Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 24, 2005, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $865 million, of which $606 million related to leases for retail space. 89    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 10Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $140 million, $103 million, and $97 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 24, 2005, are as follows (in millions):      Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. The following table reconciles changes in the Companys accrued warranties and related costs (in millions):             2005       2004       2003         Beginning accrued   warranty and related costs       $   105       $   67       $   69         Cost of warranty   claims       (188   )   (105   )   (71   )     Accruals for   product warranties       271       143       69         Ending accrued warranty   and related costs       $   188       $   105       $   67           The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 24, 2005 or September 25, 2004. 90    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 10Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Companys CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. Long-Term Supply Agreements Subsequent to September 24, 2005, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion for flash memory components by the end of the second quarter of 2006. Contingencies The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that  91    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 10Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, except as described below for the Retail segment. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $132 million, $104 million, and $92 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. This measure of operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable basis for comparison between the Companys various geographic segments. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 92    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data (Continued) Management assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the Companys geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the Companys major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results of the Companys other segments. First, the Retail segments operating income includes cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Companys cost to support those partners. For the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $435 million, $213 million, and $106 million, respectively. Second, the Companys service and support contracts are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the Companys major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a measure of revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the Companys Retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the Companys service and support contracts at the time of sale. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 24, 2005, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $92 million and $64 million, respectively. For the year ended September 25, 2004, the net sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of service and support contracts were $54 million and $37 million, respectively. For the year ended September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $30 million and $20 million, respectively. Third, the Company has opened seven high profile stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan, Osaka, Japan, and London, England as of September 24, 2005. These high profile stores are larger than the Companys typical retail stores and were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these stores were $31 million, $16 million, and $6 million for the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively. 93    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data (Continued) Summary information by operating segment follows (in millions):             2005       2004       2003         Americas:                                 Net sales       $   6,590       $   4,019       $   3,181         Operating income       $   798       $   465       $   323         Depreciation, amortization, and accretion       $   6       $   6       $   5         Segment assets (a)       $   705       $   563       $   494         Europe:                                 Net sales       $   3,073       $   1,799       $   1,309         Operating income       $   454       $   280       $   130         Depreciation, amortization, and accretion       $   4       $   4       $   4         Segment assets       $   289       $   259       $   252         Japan:                                 Net sales       $   920       $   677       $   698         Operating income       $   140       $   115       $   121         Depreciation, amortization, and accretion       $   3       $   2       $   3         Segment assets       $   199       $   114       $   130         Retail:                                 Net sales       $   2,350       $   1,185       $   621         Operating income (loss)       $   151       $   39       $   (5   )     Depreciation, amortization, and accretion (b)       $   43       $   35       $   25         Segment assets (b)       $   555       $   351       $   243         Other Segments (c):                                 Net sales       $   998       $   599       $   398         Operating income       $   118       $   90       $   51         Depreciation, amortization, and accretion       $   2       $   2       $   2         Segment assets       $   133       $   124       $   78            (a)          The Americas asset figures do not include fixed assets held in the U.S. Such fixed assets are not allocated specifically to the Americas segment and are included in the corporate assets figures below.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 24, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 29, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of internal control over financial reporting. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in 2003.       /s/ KPMG LLP     Mountain View,   California         November 29, 2005        98    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Apple Computer, Inc.: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Apple Computer, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Apple Computer, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Apple Computer, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Apple Computer, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. as of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 24, 2005, and our report dated November 29, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.       /s/ KPMG LLP     Mountain View,   California         November 29, 2005          99     Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) were effective as of September 24, 2005 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; (ii)   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and (iii)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was  100    effective as of September 24, 2005. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Companys assessment of its internal control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting appears on page 99 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified in managements evaluation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Role of the Board; Corporate Governance Matters It is the paramount duty of the Board of Directors to oversee the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management in the competent and ethical operation of the Company on a day-to-day basis and to assure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served. To satisfy this duty, the directors take a proactive, focused approach to their position, and set standards to ensure that the Company is committed to business success through maintenance of the highest standards of responsibility and ethics. Members of the Board bring to the Company a wide range of experience, knowledge and judgment. These varied skills mean that governance is far more than a check the box approach to standards or procedures. The governance structure in the Company is designed to be a working structure for principled actions, effective decision-making and appropriate monitoring of both compliance and performance. The key practices and procedures of the Board are outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines available on the Companys website at www.apple.com/investor. Board Committees The Board has a standing Compensation Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (Nominating Committee) and an Audit and Finance Committee (Audit Committee).

Members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Campbell and York and Dr. Levinson. The Compensation Committee is primarily responsible for reviewing the compensation arrangements for the Companys executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, and for administering the Companys equity compensation plans. Members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Campbell, Drexler, and Gore. The Nominating Committee assists the Board in identifying qualified individuals to become directors, determines the composition of the Board and its committees, monitors the process to assess Board effectiveness and helps develop and implement the Companys corporate governance guidelines. The Nominating Committee also considers nominees proposed by shareholders. Members of the Nominating Committee are Messrs. Drexler and Gore and Dr. Levinson. The Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees operate under written charters adopted by the Board. These charters are available on Apples website at www.apple.com/investor. Audit Committee Financial Expert All members of the Companys Audit Committee, Messrs. Campbell and York and Dr. Levinson, qualify as audit committee financial experts under Item 401 (h) of Regulation S-K and are considered independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act. Code of Ethics The Company has a code of ethics that applies to all of the Companys employees, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and its Board of Directors.

(2)          Consists of 120,000 options granted to Mr. Jobs in his capacity as a director pursuant to the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan. Since accepting the position of CEO, Mr. Jobs is no longer eligible to receive option grants under the Director Plan. In March 2003, Mr. Jobs voluntarily cancelled all of his outstanding options, excluding those granted to him in his capacity as a director. (3)          This does not include 10 million restricted shares granted to Mr. Jobs, 600,000 restricted stock units granted to Mr. Cook, and 500,000 restricted stock units granted to each of Messrs. Johnson, Oppenheimer, and Rubinstein. Director Compensation The form and amount of director compensation is determined by the Board after a review of recommendations made by the Nominating Committee. The current practice of the Board is to base a substantial portion of a directors annual retainer on equity. In 1998, shareholders approved the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan (the Director Plan) and 1,600,000 shares were reserved for issuance thereunder. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Companys non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon their initial election to the Board (Initial Options). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee directors initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock (Annual Options). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. As of the end of the fiscal year, there were options for 740,000 shares outstanding under the Director Plan. Since accepting the position of CEO, Mr. Jobs is no longer eligible for grants under the Director Plan. Non-employee directors also receive a $50,000 annual retainer paid in quarterly increments. In addition, directors receive up to two free computer systems per year and are eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount. Directors do not receive any additional consideration for serving on committees or as committee chairperson. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Campbell, Drexler and Gore, none of whom are employees of the Company and all of whom are considered independent directors under the  107    applicable NASDAQ rules. There were no interlocks or insider participation between any member of the Board or Compensation Committee and any member of the board of the directors or compensation committee of another company. Arrangements with Named Executive Officers Change In Control ArrangementsStock Options, Restricted Stock, and Restricted Stock Units In the event of a change in control of the Company, all outstanding options under the Companys stock option plans, except the Director Plan, will, unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator, become fully exercisable, and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable change in control price and the exercise price. The Director Plan provides that upon a change in control of the Company, all outstanding options held by non-employee directors will automatically become fully exercisable and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable change in control price and the exercise price of the options. A change in control under these plans is generally defined as (i) the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Companys outstanding securities or (ii) the occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation. In addition, options, restricted stock grants, and restricted stock units granted to the Named Executive Officers generally provide that in the event there is a change in control, as defined in the Companys stock option plans, and if in connection with or following such change in control, their employment is terminated without Cause or if they should resign for Good Reason, those options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units outstanding that are not yet vested as of the date of such change in control shall become fully vested. Further, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to the Named Executive Officers also provide that, in the event the Company terminates the Officer without cause at any time, the restricted stock units and restricted stock will vest in full. Generally, Cause is defined to include a felony conviction, willful disclosure of confidential information or willful and continued failure to perform his or her employment duties. Good Reason includes resignation of employment as a result of a substantial diminution in position or duties, or an adverse change in title or reduction in annual base salary.

Audit and Non-Audit Fees       (1)          Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Companys annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, quarterly review of financial statements included in the Companys Forms 10-Q, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. (2)          Audit-related fees primarily relate to professional services for the audits of employee benefit plans. (3)          Tax fees include $690,000 for professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and preparation relating to the Companys expatriate program, tax audits and international tax compliance; and $233,000 for international tax consulting and planning services. The Company does not engage KPMG to perform personal tax services for its executive officers. Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Auditors Prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act), the Company adopted an auditor independence policy that banned its auditors from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This auditor policy also mandates that the audit and non-audit services and related budget be approved by the Audit Committee in advance, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. In accordance with this policy, all services to be performed by KPMG were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Subsequent to the enactment of the Act, the Audit Committee met with KPMG to further understand the provisions of that Act as it relates to auditor independence. KPMG rotated the lead audit partner for fiscal year 2005 and will rotate other partners as appropriate in compliance with the Act. The Audit Committee will continue to monitor the activities undertaken by KPMG to comply with the Act. 111     PART IV Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.
