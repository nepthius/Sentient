Apple has played a role in the development, enhancement, promotion, and/or use of numerous of these industry standards, many of which are discussed below.  Retail   Since inception of its retail initiative in 2001, the Company has opened 65 retail stores in the United States through fiscal year 2003 and during the first quarter of 2004 opened 9 additional stores, including its first international store in the Ginza in Tokyo, Japan. The Company has located its stores at high traffic  1     locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. In addition to its own hardware, software and peripheral products, the Company's stores carry a variety of third-party hardware and software products.  One of the main goals of the retail initiative is to bring new customers to the Company and expand its installed base through sales to both first time personal computer buyers and those switching to the Macintosh platform from competing operating system platforms. By operating its own stores, the Company is able to better control the customer retail experience. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of personal computing products. To that end, retail store configurations have expanded to various sizes in order to accommodate market demands. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel, provide post-sale advice and support, offer a wide selection of third-party products selected to complement the Company's own products, host training and marketing presentations, and provide certain hardware support services. Additionally, the stores provide a forum in which the Company is able to present entire computing solutions to users in areas such as digital photography, digital video, music, children's software, and home and small business computing.  Education   For more than 25 years, the Company has focused on the use of technology in education. The Company believes that effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement, especially when used to support collaboration, information access, and the expression and representation of student thought and ideas. The Company provides a range of products and services designed to help schools maximize their investments in technology. This is manifested in many of the Company's products and services, including hardware products like the eMac and the iBook® that are designed to meet the needs of education customers, video editing solutions, wireless networking capabilities, student information systems, one-to-one learning solutions, and high-quality curriculum and professional development solutions.

A Bluetooth USB adaptor can Bluetooth-enable any USB-based Macintosh computer running in Mac OS X version 10.1.4 or higher.  The Company's Rendezvous networking technology is based on open Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard Protocols such as IP, ARP and DNS. Rendezvous uses industry standard networking protocols and zero configuration technology to automatically discover and connect devices over any IP network, including Ethernet or 802.11-based wireless networks like the Company's AirPort product. Major developers such as Canon, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, Philips, Sybase, World Book and Xerox have announced support for Rendezvous in a broad range of products including network printers, consumer electronics, enterprise database management and educational applications. The Company has made the Rendezvous source code freely available allowing developers to use Rendezvous technology in their network-enabled devices or software applications. The Rendezvous source code includes software to support UNIX, Linux, and Windows-based systems and devices. Rendezvous support is built into Mac OS X.  The Company developed FireWire® technology, also referred to as IEEE 1394, which is a high-speed serial I/O technology for connecting digital devices such as digital camcorders and cameras to desktop and portable computers. With its high data-transfer speed and "hot plug-and-play" capability, FireWire has become an established cross-platform industry standard for both consumers and professionals and is the data interface of choice for today's digital video and audio devices, as well as external hard drives and other high-speed peripherals. FireWire is currently included on all Macintosh systems and is a data transfer technology utilized by iPod.

Apple Professional Services offers a range of custom, personalized technical services, including Internet consulting and setup, installation and integration services. The Company also offers specialized loan programs including loans for consumers, students, and educators. Apple also provides leasing solutions for its education institution customers and its business and professional customers. The Company uses several third-party lenders to originate and carry these loans and leases, all of which are non-recourse to the Company.  Specialized Education Products and Services   The Company offers a variety of unique services and products to its education customers, including a separate online store for education customers offering special education price lists and promotions; special financing programs for K-12 and higher education students, faculty, and staff; a special edition of its productivity software suite, AppleWorks, that is cross platform for both Macintosh and Windows computers; the iBook Wireless Mobile Lab that allows teachers and students to share iBook computers, a printer, and a wireless network/Internet connection stored on a cart for mobility between classrooms; and  10     three special Digital Media Studio solutions designed for education, including one that is integrated into a mobile cart. Additionally, Apple Professional Services offers a range of technical services to education customers.  In 2001, Apple acquired PowerSchool Inc., a privately held provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and school districts. PowerSchool® software products give school administrators and teachers the ability to easily and cost-effectively manage student records and give parents real-time access to track their children's performance via the Internet. PowerSchool offers the option of remote hosting with an application service provider model.  Markets and Distribution   The Company's customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and business markets. Certain customers are attracted to Macintosh computers for a variety of reasons, including the reduced amount of training resulting from the Macintosh computer's intuitive ease of use, advanced graphics capabilities, industrial design features of the Company's hardware products, and ability of Macintosh computers to network and communicate with other computer systems and environments. Apple personal computers were first introduced to education customers in the late 1970s. Over 18% of the Company's net sales in 2003 were to education customers in the United States, including sales to elementary and secondary schools and college and university customers.  The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2003, 2002 or 2001. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education customers, consumers, businesses, and certain resellers through its retail stores in the United States, or through one of its online stores around the world. Total direct and indirect sales attributable to the Company's online stores totaled approximately $2.9 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.0 billion for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Competition   The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The market for the design, manufacture, and sale of personal computers and related software and peripheral products is highly competitive. This market continues to be characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software development, which have substantially increased the capabilities and applications of these products, and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products and significant price, feature, and performance competition. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins.  The principal competitive factors in the market for personal computers include relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products.  The Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of innovations in competing platforms. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms.  11         The Company's initial success with the development of an end-to-end music offering, which includes the iTunes digital music management software, iTunes Music Store and iPod digital music player, has already encouraged significant competition in this area from other companies, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, and manufacturing resources than those of the Company. The Company believes it maintains a competitive advantage by more effectively integrating the entire end-to-end music solution, including the hardware (iPod), software (iTunes) and music content (iTunes Music Store).  Raw Materials   Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days.  The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Broadcom Corporation, Compal Corporation, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., IBM Corporation, International Display Technology, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Motorola, Inc., Nvidia Corp., Quanta Computer, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Synaptics, Inc., and Toshiba Corporation.  Research and Development   Because the personal computer industry is characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company's research and development expenditures, before any charges for purchased in-process research and development, totaled $471 million, $446 million, and $430 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  12     Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses   The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, peripheral systems, and software. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries for "Apple," the Apple logo, "Macintosh," and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.  Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data   The United States represents the Company's largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 58% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2003 came from sales to customers inside the United States. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company's manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company's products and final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod are performed by third-party vendors in Japan, Taiwan and China. Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, "Segment Information and Geographic Data."  Seasonal Business   Although the Company does not consider its business to be highly seasonal, it has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters, compared to other quarters in its fiscal year, due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the school year, respectively. Past performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty   The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most Apple hardware products in all of the Company's major markets.  Backlog   In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation  13     of or immediately following new product introductions because of over ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.  Environmental Laws   Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the subject of these laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse affect on the Company.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member states, Japan and California. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse affect on the Company.  Employees   As of September 27, 2003, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide had 10,912 employees and an additional 2,654 temporary employees and contractors.  Available Information   Beginning in fiscal 2003, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available on its website at www.apple.com/investor when such reports are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website. The public may read and copy any materials filed by the Company with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, the Company's references to the URLs for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.      Item 2. Properties      The Company's headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. The Company has manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California and Cork, Ireland. As of September 27, 2003, the Company leased approximately 3.2 million square feet of space, primarily in the United States, and to a lesser extent, in Europe, Japan, and the Asia Pacific region. Leased space in the United States includes 538,000 square feet of retail space. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 15 years and often contain multi-year renewal options.  The Company owns its manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, which has approximately 352,000 square feet. The Company also owns a 752,000 square-foot facility in Sacramento, California, which is used as a manufacturing, warehousing and distribution center. The Sacramento and Cork facilities also house  14      customer support call centers. In addition, the Company owns 930,000 square feet of facilities located in Cupertino, California, used for research and development and corporate functions. Outside the United States, the Company owns additional facilities totaling approximately 169,000 square feet.  The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment are well maintained and in good operating condition. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors, and therefore believes it has adequate manufacturing capacity for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products.      Item 3. Legal Proceedings      The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed below. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain legal matters in 2003, which did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.  Antor Media Corporation v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al.   Plaintiff, Antor Media filed this action on September 5, 2003 in the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement by the Company and other defendants of patent 5,754,961 relating to a "Method and Apparatus for Transmitting Information Recorded on Information Storage Means from a Central Server to Subscribers via a High Data Rate Digital Telecommunications Network."

The case was initially stayed pending the Federal Circuit's decision in Datapoint Corp. v. Standard Microsystems Corp., a related case in which plaintiff claimed that its patent was infringed by products complying with the fast Ethernet standard. In February 2002, the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment of non-infringement in Datapoint, and the District Court lifted the stay in this action. The defendants in this action filed a joint motion for summary judgment based upon the decision in Datapoint. The Court heard the motion on October 4, 2002 and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on February 11, 2003. Dynacore has appealed the ruling.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data      The following selected financial information has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements. The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of results of future operations, and should be read in conjunction with Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K in order to fully understand factors that may affect the comparability of the information presented below.     Net gains before taxes related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments of $10 million, $75 million, $367 million, and $230 million were recognized in 2003, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. A net loss before taxes related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments of $42 million was  19      recognized in 2002. In 2002, the Company acquired Emagic resulting in a charge of approximately $1 million for acquired in-process technologies with no alternative future use. The Company recognized a similar charge of $11 million in 2001 related to its acquisition of PowerSchool. Net charges related to Company restructuring actions of $26 million, $30 million, $8 million, and $27 million were recognized in 2003, 2002, 2000, and 1999, respectively. During 2000, the Company recognized the cost of a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million. In 2002, of the original $90 million accrual, $2 million remained unspent and was reversed. In 2003, settlement of the Company's forward stock purchase agreement resulted in a gain of $6 million. Favorable cumulative-effect type adjustments of $1 million and $12 million were recognized in 2003 and 2001, respectively.      Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      This section and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "plans," "predicts," and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Critical Accounting Policies   The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Management believes the following to be critical accounting policies. That is, they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Revenue Recognition   Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (i.e., hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains  20      a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed and determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.  Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments   The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product lifecycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required  21     to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded.  The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles   The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Company's business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to such impairment adjustments in the future periods in which such business issues are identified.  The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the Company's business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the Company determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be determined.  Based on the Company's estimates as of September 27, 2003, there was no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including changes in the Company's market capitalization, changes in the Company's forecasts, and changes in the Company's internal business structure could cause one or more of the Company's reporting units to be valued differently thereby causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill.  Warranty Costs   The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical experience of failure rates. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts  22     as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company's results of operations.  Income Taxes   The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.  Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.  23      Net Sales   Net sales and Macintosh unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product follow (net sales in millions and Macintosh unit sales in thousands):      Notes:  (a)Other segments consists of Asia Pacific and FileMaker. Certain net sales in 2002 and 2001 related to recent acquisitions and Internet services have been reclassified from Other segments net sales to Americas segment net sales to conform to the 2003 presentation.  24      (b)Power Macintosh figures include server sales. (c)Net sales of peripherals and other hardware include sales of iPod, Apple-branded and third-party displays, and other hardware accessories. (d)Net sales of software include sales of Apple-branded operating system and application software and sales of third-party software. (e)Net sales per Macintosh unit sold is derived by dividing total Macintosh net sales by total Macintosh unit sales.  Fiscal Year 2003 versus 2002   Net sales increased $465 million or 8% during 2003 compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined 3% year-over-year to approximately 3 million units in 2003. Several factors have contributed favorably to net sales during 2003 including:    The Retail segment's net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002, an increase of 119%. While the Company's customers may elect to purchase product from their local Apple Retail store rather than through other preexisting sales channels in the United States, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segment's net sales is incremental to total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance." Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose $384 million or 57% during 2003 compared 2002, which follows a $287 million or 74% increase in 2002 as compared to 2001. The current year increase was primarily driven by the $202 million, or 141%, year-over-year increase in iPod net sales to $345 million. All of the Company's operating segments experienced substantial increases in iPod net sales and unit sales during 2003. iPod sales during 2003 were favorably affected by the introduction of substantially redesigned new models, which are compatible with both Macintosh and Windows operating systems and by the Company's introduction of its iTunes Music Store for the Macintosh operating system in April 2003. The Company's iPod digital music player is sold by a variety of resellers, many of which do not currently market the Company's Macintosh systems. The Company has expanded this distribution network during 2003, which has contributed to the current year increase in iPod unit sales of 146%.   In addition to the iPod, the increase in net sales of peripherals and other hardware during 2003 also reflects an overall increase in net sales of other computer accessories including AirPort cards and base stations, which facilitate wireless connectivity; third party digital cameras and printers; and a number of portable computer related accessories.  Although total Macintosh unit sales were down 3% in 2003, unit sales of the Company's portable systems were relatively strong primarily due to the 69% or 247,000 unit increase in PowerBook unit sales, slightly offset by a 4% or 30,000 unit decrease in iBook unit sales. The increase in PowerBook net sales of $468 million or 56% is due primarily to the success of the Company's new 12-inch, 15-inch and 17-inch models that were introduced during 2003. The decline in iBook consumer portable sales during 2003 is primarily due to a lower average price per unit. Portable systems represented 42% of all Macintosh systems sold in 2003 versus 33% in 2002 and 31% in 2001, which reflects an overall industry trend towards portable systems. The Company's average net sales per Macintosh unit sold increased 2% to $1,491 in 2003 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix towards relatively higher-priced PowerBook systems and an increase in direct sales primarily from the Company's retail and online stores, offset by somewhat lower year-over-year pricing on comparable Macintosh systems for most of the Company's Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure, particularly with the Company's   25       iBook consumer portable systems. PowerBook and Power Macintosh systems accounted for 42% of total unit sales in 2003 versus 36% in 2002.    Net sales of software increased $55 million or 18% during 2003 compared to the prior year and reflects higher net sales of Apple-branded application and server software and third-party software. Net sales of Apple-branded application and server software increased due to the introduction of several new software titles during the year including Final Cut Express, iLife, and Keynote, as well as from higher sales of software related to recent acquisitions including PowerSchool and Emagic. Growth in net sales of third-party software during 2003 was particularly strong in the Americas Segment due to strong sales of software by the Company's online store and its Retail segment. Service and other sales rose $69 million or 30% during 2003 and results from significant year-over-year increases in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended maintenance and support services, as well as the Company's Internet related services. Increased net sales associated with APP are primarily the result of increasing attach rates over the last several years. Increased net sales associated with Internet services are due to net sales from the iTunes Music Store introduced in April 2003 and increased net sales of the Company's .Mac Internet service.   Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales during 2003 were negatively impacted by the following factors:    Total unit sales of desktop systems fell 15% during 2003 compared to 2002. iMac systems unit sales declined 16% from 2003 to 2002 resulting from a shift in sales away from desktop systems in favor of portables. Also, the current flat panel iMac form factor was in the eighth quarter of its life cycle by the end of 2003 and did not experience significant enhancements until the release of the 20-inch flat-panel iMac in November 2003. Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. For the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems decreased 24%, which is representative of the decline of Power Macintosh systems sales experienced by the Company during recent years and is also believed to be attributable to delays in purchasing pending the release of the Power Mac G5. As expected, this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of 2003 with unit sales increasing 26% during the quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year due largely to the new Power Mac G5, which the Company introduced in June 2003 and began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. The decline in Power Macintosh sales over the last several years also reflects the shift in sales to portable systems, particularly PowerBooks. In addition, the Company continues to believe that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers. Additionally, some of the Company's professional and creative customers may have delayed upgrades of their systems in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications to run natively on Mac OS X. Currently there are many applications that run natively on Mac OS X, including Adobe's PhotoShop 7 and QuarkXPress 6; however, there is no assurance that this will result in additional sales of Macintosh systems, particularly Power Macintosh units. The Company has continued to experience ongoing weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Net sales and unit sales in U.S. education during 2003 were down 4% and 6%, respectively, as compared to 2002. This decline was due to a decrease in K-12 sales, partially offset by an increase in higher education sales. Net sales declined primarily as a result of a continued shift in mix away from higher priced Power Macintosh and iMac systems towards lower priced eMac and iBook systems, although the Company did experience a significant increase in sales of its PowerBook systems primarily to higher education customers. Portable systems accounted for approximately 43% of total unit sales in the education channel during 2003, as compared to approximately 34% in 2002.   26       The Company's one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook portable system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. The Company has experienced significant competition in 1:1 learning solutions and, accordingly, has experienced a lower sales price per unit, on average, in these transactions.  The Company believes weakness in its U.S. education channel, particularly K-12, has been caused by multiple factors including funding pressures due to weak economic conditions, large budget deficits in many states, and increased competition particularly for desktop computers. Although the Company has taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to address weakness in the U.S. education channel, it remains difficult to anticipate when and if this negative trend will reverse.    The personal computer industry in general, and the Company specifically, continue to see relatively soft demand for their products. Sales of professional and consumer oriented Macintosh systems remain far below levels experienced in fiscal 2000 and earlier. Difficult global economic conditions during the past several years exacerbated by the economic and political uncertainties caused by terrorist activities and the associated international responses have clearly had a pronounced negative effect on the overall demand for the Company's products in virtually all of its markets. Further, growth in the overall personal computer industry has slowed due to the high market penetration of personal computers and a lengthening of consumer, creative, and business personal computer upgrade cycles.   Fiscal Year 2002 versus 2001   Net sales increased $379 million or 7% during 2002 compared to 2001, while Macintosh unit sales were relatively flat year-over-year at approximately 3.1 million units. On a geographic basis, performance in the domestic market was relatively strong, especially when considering the performance of the Company's Retail segment, which operated during 2002 exclusively in the United States. However, the European and Japanese markets remained sluggish throughout 2002. The Company's net sales in 2002 were positively influenced by a number of factors.    First, net sales from software, service, peripherals, and other sources rose $248 million or 26% in 2002 versus 2001. This increase was driven by several factors including a 28% increase in combined third-party and Apple-branded software sales; $143 million in net sales of iPod, the Company's portable digital music player that was introduced in the first half of 2002; a 9% increase in the sale of computer accessories; and a 14% increase in service revenue caused primarily by increased revenue associated with extended maintenance and support contracts. The growth in software revenue was primarily the result of increased sales of third-party software in the Company's retail and online stores and expansion in recent years in the number of Apple-branded software titles. Second, overall unit sales of Macintosh portable systems grew by 92,000 units or 10% in 2002 reflecting a general trend in the personal computer market away from desktop systems towards portable systems. During 2002, portable Macintosh systems represented 33% of total systems sales versus 31% in 2001 and 20% in 2000. Growth in this area has been most pronounced for iBook, the Company's education and consumer oriented portable Macintosh system. iBook unit sales increased 14% in 2002 and 9% in 2001. Third, the Company's Retail segment grew from 8 stores at the end of 2001 to 40 stores at the end of 2002. The Retail segment's net sales grew from $19 million in 2001 to $283 million in 2002. While the Retail segment may have cannibalized some net sales from the Company's preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company believed that a substantial portion of the Retail segment's net sales was incremental to the Company's total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance."   27             Fourth, the Company's average unit pricing increased 3% during 2002 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix offset by somewhat lower pricing year-over-year on comparative Macintosh systems. Net sales per Macintosh unit sold during 2002 of $1,462 per unit reflected the shift in mix towards relatively higher-priced portable Macintosh systems and reflected the impact on net sales of the relatively higher-priced new iMac design introduced during 2002. The impact of these changes in mix were offset by the decline in unit sales of relatively higher-priced Power Macintosh systems and by lower pricing on comparative Macintosh systems during 2002 for most of the Company's Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure. Fifth, any comparison of net sales in 2002 versus 2001 must consider the effect of unusually low net sales during the first quarter of 2001. This was attributable to several factors at the beginning of 2001, including continued deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers, rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during that quarter that cost the Company approximately $138 million, and a plan implemented by the Company during the first quarter of 2001 that reduced substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels that resulted in a decline in channel inventory of approximately 300,000 units during that quarter.   Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales in 2002 were negatively impacted by several notable factors.    First, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002 as compared to 2001. This followed a 35% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales in 2001 from 2000. The Company believed that weak economic conditions over the past several years had a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers and that many of these customers continued to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Company's ongoing transition to Mac OS X, its new operating system, and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their Macintosh applications to run natively in Mac OS X. Further, the Company did not experience the anticipated increase in Power Macintosh sales that it expected following the introduction of Adobe's PhotoShop 7 during 2002. Additionally, many professional users may have postponed upgrading their systems until after the introduction of Mac OS X Jaguar released in the fourth quarter of 2002. Others may have delayed upgrading until after the availability of other professionally oriented software applications for Mac OS X such as QuarkXPress. Second, despite the overall increase in net sales during 2002 in the Americas, the Company continued to see weakness in its U.S. education channel. Total net sales in this channel fell 15% in 2002 and 4% in 2001. These declines were consistent with industry data that showed the Company losing market share in the U.S. education market in each of the last two fiscal years. The Company believed this weakness was caused by multiple factors, including increased price competition in this price sensitive market from the Company's competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers. Additionally, some of the Company's education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding. Third, the personal computer industry in general and the Company specifically experienced soft demand for its products due to adverse global economic conditions, political uncertainties, and a lengthening of consumer, creative, and business personal computer upgrade cycles.   Segment Operating Performance   The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Retail segment currently operates  28     Apple-owned retail stores in the United States and opened its first international store in Tokyo, Japan in the first quarter of 2004. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, "Segment Information and Geographic Data."  Americas   Net sales in the Americas segment during 2003 increased $50 million or 2% compared to 2002. During 2003 and 2002, the Americas segment represented approximately 51% and 55%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales and represented approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The results of the Americas segment are similar to the overall results of the Company as they reflect substantially lower unit sales and net sales of Power Macintosh systems and iMac systems, partially offset by increases in unit sales and net sales of PowerBooks. The net sales of the Americas segment, and the Company in total, also reflect substantially higher sales of peripherals, software, and services during 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to higher sales of iPods and Internet services. The Americas segment has been negatively affected by weakness in its U.S. education channel. As noted above, total net sales and unit sales in the U.S. education channel during 2003 were down 4% and 6%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2002. The Company believes this decline is caused by increased competition in the education market and by a reduction in spending by U.S. educational institutions due to federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy. Additionally, some of the decline during 2003 in net sales and unit sales of Macintosh systems in the Americas segment may be the result of the operation of the Company's Retail segment whose net sales, all of which occurred within the U.S., increased significantly during 2003.  Net sales for the Americas segment increased 3% or $94 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The Americas segment was negatively affected by a decline in U.S. education sales in 2002 of $215 million. The Americas segment also experienced a 17% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales. However, outside of the U.S. education channel, unit sales of consumer desktop and portable systems rebounded from the substantial declines experienced in 2001, rising a combined 31% in 2002. Sales of software, peripherals, and accessories were also up in the Americas during 2002. Growth in unit sales of consumer oriented systems during 2002 in the Americas is somewhat attributable to the significantly depressed level of net sales experienced in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed above. However, growth in the Americas was somewhat negatively affected, particularly with respect to consumer-oriented systems, by the significant growth of the Company's Retail segment in the U.S. More than 70% of the Retail segment's Macintosh unit sales during 2002 were for iMacs and iBooks.  Europe   Net sales in Europe increased $58 million or 5% during 2003 as compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined by 5% during the same period. Europe's operating results were consistent with the trend experienced in the Americas and by the Company as a whole. Europe experienced weakened demand for Power Macintosh, iMac and iBook systems in 2003, partially offset by strong demand for PowerBooks whose net sales increased by 48% or $100 million from 2002. Europe also realized increased sales of peripherals, software, and service, primarily attributable to higher sales of iPods, accessories and APP.  Economic conditions in Europe remained weak throughout 2002, and the overall demand for the Company's products in that region remained flat during 2002 versus 2001. Unit sales in Europe for 2002 reflect relatively stronger demand for consumer-oriented products, particularly iBook whose unit sales increased 27% in 2002, offset by declines in Power Macintosh unit sales.  Japan   Net sales in Japan decreased $12 million or 2% during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002, the weakest year-to-date performance of any of the Company's operating segments. Japan's Macintosh unit  29     sales were particularly weak in 2003, declining 12%, and were primarily attributable to lower sales of iMac and iBook systems, partially offset by an increase in PowerBook sales as well as higher sales of peripherals and other hardware. Japan's Macintosh unit sales remain significantly below the segment's historic levels due to current economic conditions that remain particularly negative in Japan.  Net sales in Japan remained flat during 2002 versus 2001, with a slight decline in unit sales of 2%. Consistent with the Company's other geographic operating segments, during 2002 Japan showed growth in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of Power Macintosh systems. Japan's iMac unit sales increased 85% in 2002. However, in the case of Japan the increase in iMac unit shipments in 2002 versus 2001 was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the Company in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed above. Additionally, net sales in Japan on a sequential and year-over-year comparative basis generally worsened as 2002 progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions in Japan.  Retail   The Company opened 25 new retail stores during 2003, bringing the total number of open stores to 65 as of September 27, 2003, which compares to 40 open stores as of September 28, 2002 and 8 open stores as of September 29, 2001. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company opened 9 additional stores including its first international store in the Ginza in Tokyo, Japan. The Retail segment's net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002 and from $19 million in 2001. The $338 million or 119% increase in net sales during 2003 reflects the impact from opening 25 new stores in 2003, the full year impact of 2002 store openings, as well as an increase in average revenue per store. Total Macintosh sales increased by approximately $170 million of which $108 million related to year-over-year increases in PowerBook sales. The Retail segment has also contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of peripherals, software and services experienced by the Company during 2003. During 2003, approximately 45% of the Retail segment's net sales came from the sale of Apple-branded and third-party peripherals, software and services as compared to 28% for the Company as a whole. With an average of 54 stores open during 2003, the Retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $11.5 million, as compared to approximately $10.2 million based on an average of 28 stores open in 2002.  As measured by the Company's operating segment reporting, the Retail segment improved from a loss of $22 million during 2002 to a loss of $5 million during 2003. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segment's year-over-year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation and other fixed costs.  Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled approximately $290 million through the end of fiscal 2003, $92 million of which was incurred during 2003. As of September 27, 2003, the Retail segment had approximately 1,300 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $354 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Investment in a new business model such as the Retail segment is inherently risky, particularly in light of the significant investment involved, the current economic climate, and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the Retail segment's operating expenses.  30      Gross Margin   Gross margin for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2003 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):     Gross margin decreased to 27.5% of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% of net sales in 2002. This decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several Macintosh models instituted by the Company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry, lower sales of relatively higher margin Power Macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003, and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new Power Mac G5 and 15-inch PowerBook, both of which began shipping in volume during September 2003. This decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed. The aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales.  The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2004 in light of weak economic conditions, price competition in the personal computer industry, and potential increases in component pricing. The Company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges on the Power Mac G5 and other products during 2004.  The foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross margin during 2004, general demand for personal computers, anticipated industry component pricing, anticipated air freight charges, and future economic conditions are forward-looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained, targeted gross margin levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.  The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company's operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  Gross margin increased to 27.9% of net sales in 2002 from 23.0% in 2001. Gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% experienced in the first quarter of 2001. As a  31      percentage of net sales, the Company's quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% in the first quarter down to 26% in the fourth quarter. This decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the Company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry.  Operating Expenses   Operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2003 are as follows (in millions, except for percentages):         2003   2002   2001     Research and development   $ 471   $ 446   $ 430       Percentage of net sales     8 %   8 %   8 %   Selling, general, and administrative expenses   $ 1,212   $ 1,109   $ 1,138       Percentage of net sales     20 %   19 %   21 %   Restructuring costs   $ 26   $ 30          Purchased in-process research and development        $ 1   $ 11      Research and Development (R&D)   The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&D expense amounted to approximately 8% of total net sales during 2003, 2002 and 2001, up substantially from approximately 5% of total net sales in fiscal year 2000 and recent earlier periods. The Company's management believes that maintaining or increasing the pace of innovation and product development is the best way to respond to current economic and market conditions and will continue to position the Company for future growth as conditions improve. R&D expense increased 6% or $25 million to $471 million in 2003 as compared to 2002, which follows a $16 million increase in 2002 as compared to 2001. The overall increase in R&D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities. R&D spending also included capitalized software development costs of approximately $14.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Panther in 2003; approximately $13.3 million associated with the development of Mac OS X Jaguar and approximately $6 million associated with the PowerSchool enterprise student information system in 2002; and approximately $5.4 million associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X in 2001. Further information related to the Company's capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)   SG&A increased $103 million or 9% during 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to the Company's continued expansion of the Retail segment and increases in headcount. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in current year discretionary spending on marketing and advertising and by savings resulting from the 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described below.  SG&A decreased $29 million or 3% during 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease in SG&A in 2002 was primarily the result of lower discretionary spending on marketing and advertising expenses, decreased spending related to information systems, and benefits directly related to the Company's restructuring actions in 2002 and 2001. The decreases were partially offset by higher sales expense in 2002 resulting from increased operating expenses associated with expansion of the Company's Retail segment.  32      Restructuring Actions   During the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million. The primary focus of actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with PowerSchool related activities in the Americas operating segment. The second quarter actions resulted in recognition of severance costs of $2.4 million for termination of 93 employees, 92 of whom were terminated prior to the end of 2003 at a cost of $2.2 million. During the second quarter of 2003, an additional $400,000 was accrued for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility in the Americas operating segment. The Company estimates these restructuring actions will reduce quarterly operating expenses by $1.5 million.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide, all but one was eliminated by the end of 2003. The Company estimates these restructuring actions will reduce quarterly operating expenses by $6 million.  During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment. The Company estimates these restructuring actions will result in reduced quarterly operating expenses of approximately $10 million.  Of the $30 million restructuring charge for fiscal 2002, $6 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to actions designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. Headcount actions, primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development, resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of a PowerSchool product that resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the product in the amount of $4.5 million. The remaining charge in 2002 of $24 million was incurred in the first quarter of 2002 and resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide, at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000.  Purchased In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)   During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately $30 million in cash; $551,000 of which was allocated to IPR&D. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003, included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined  33     using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%.  In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc., a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and districts that enables schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track their children's progress. Of total purchase consideration of $66.1 million, $10.8 million was allocated to IPR&D and was expensed upon acquisition because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the PowerSchool product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed during 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%.  Other Income and Expense   Other income and expense for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2003 are as follows (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Gains (losses) on non-current investments, net   $ 10   $ (42 ) $ 88     Unrealized loss on convertible securities   $    $    $ (13 )    Interest income   $  69   $  118   $  218     Interest expense     (8 )   (11 )   (16 )   Gains on sales of short term investments, net     21     7          Other income (expense), net     (5 )   (2 )   15     Gain on forward purchase agreement     6                              Interest and other income, net   $ 83   $ 112   $ 217                    Total other income and expense   $ 93   $ 70   $ 292                     Gains and Losses on Non-current Investments   The Company has held investments in EarthLink Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM) and certain investments in private companies. These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense. Further information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  During 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $9 million, and a gain before taxes of approximately $8 million. Additionally, the Company sold its remaining investment in ARM stock, 278,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a  34      gain before taxes of $270,000, and sold its remaining investment in EarthLink stock, 6,540,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. The fair value of the Company's remaining investment in Akamai as of September 27, 2003, was approximately $5 million.  During 2002, the Company determined that declines in the fair value of certain of these investments were other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in EarthLink, a $6 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in Akamai, and a $15 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in a private company investment. These losses in 2002 were partially offset by the sale of 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000, the sale of 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000, and the sale of approximately 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million.  During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $36 million, and sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $176 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $174 million. These gains during 2001 were partially offset by a $114 million charge to earnings that reflected an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the Company's investment in EarthLink and an $8 million charge that reflected an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of certain private company investments.  Unrealized Loss on Convertible Securities   On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 required the Company to adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to earnings during the first quarter of 2001, the before tax effect of which was an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million.  Interest and Other Income, Net   Net interest and other income decreased $29 million or 26% to $83 million during 2003. The decrease is primarily the result of declining investment yields on the Company's cash and short-term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 1.89% in 2003 compared to 2.85% in 2002. The decrease is offset by the increase of $14 million from the gain on the sales of short term investments from the Company's fixed income portfolio, and the increase of $6 million from the gain on the forward purchase agreement during the fourth quarter of 2003.  Net interest and other income was $112 million in fiscal 2002, compared to $217 million in fiscal 2001. This $105 million or 48% decrease was primarily the result of declining investment yields on the Company's cash and short-term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 2.85% in 2002 compared to 5.38% in 2001.  Provision for Income Taxes   The Company's effective tax rate for 2003 was 26% compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to research and development credits, a non-taxable gain on stock repurchase and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes were provided. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $452 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. As of September 27, 2003, a valuation allowance of $30 million was  35     recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.  On April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed adjustments to the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2000, and the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes   Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity   On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment represented the mark-to-market adjustment to fair value for a forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a price of $16.64 per share. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003. The settlement resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million, which is included in interest and other income, net.  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations   On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during 2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.  Accounting for Derivatives   The adoption of SFAS 133 during 2001 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $12 million, net of a related income tax effect of approximately $5 million.  Further information related to the adoption of SFAS Nos. 133, 143 and 150 and the resulting cumulative accounting effects may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,  36      Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as further discussed in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.  The FASB decided on April 22, 2003 to require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options. Companies will be required to measure the cost of employee stock options according to their fair value. The FASB has indicated that it plans to issue in the first quarter of calendar year 2004 an exposure draft of a new accounting standard addressing this matter. Prior to issuance of this exposure draft, the FASB has indicated it will be addressing several significant technical issues. Among other things, the FASB must determine the extent to which the new accounting standard will permit adjustments to recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and actual performance outcomes. This determination will affect the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized. Also, a method to determine the fair value of employee stock options must be established. Current accounting standards require use of an option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes formula, to determine fair value and provide guidance on adjusting some of the input factors used in the model. This valuation approach has received significant criticism and may be subject to changes that could have a significant impact on the calculated fair value of employee stock options under the new standard.  At the Company's annual shareholder's meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the Company's Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy of expensing the value of all future employee stock options issued by the Company. The Board and management appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the Company's shareholders. As discussed in the Company's Form 10-Q for the period ended March 29, 2003, the Company had decided not to expense the value of employee stock options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter. The Company based this decision on the FASB's announced intention to soon require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options and the FASB's near-term review of technical issues that will play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock options. The Company monitors progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation. In the future, should the Company expense the value of employee stock options, either out of choice or due to new requirements issued by the FASB, the Company may have to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future results of operations.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 and applied immediately to any variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an interest is obtained after that date. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2003. The adoption of the provision of FIN 46 related to variable interests created after January 31, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company continues to evaluate the provisions of FIN 46, and does not believe that the adoption of the remaining provisions will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.  37         In May 2003, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for certain arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 apply to revenue transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Additionally, in August 2003, the EITF reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-than-Incidental Software. EITF Issue No. 03-5 provides guidance on determining whether non-software deliverables are included within the scope of SOP 97-2, and accordingly, whether multiple element arrangements are to be accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-21 or SOP 97-2. The Company currently applies the requirements of SOP No. 97-2 when accounting for all multiple element transactions. The Company does not anticipate the application of either EITF Issue Nos. 00-21 or 03-5 will have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.  Liquidity and Capital Resources   The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions):        (a)DSO is based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b)Days supply of inventory is based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. (c)DPO is based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales adjusted for the change in inventory.   As of September 27, 2003, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments portfolio totaled $4.566 billion, an increase of $229 million from the end of fiscal 2002. The Company's short-term investment portfolio consists primarily of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's investments are generally liquid and investment grade.  As a result of declining investment yields on the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates during 2003, the Company has elected to reduce the average maturity of its portfolio to maintain liquidity for future investment opportunities when market interest rates increase. Accordingly, during 2003 the Company increased its holdings in short-term investment grade instruments, both in U.S. corporate and foreign securities, that are classified as cash equivalents and has reduced its holdings in longer-term U.S. corporate securities classified as short-term investments.  Although the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased in 2003, the Company's working capital at September 27, 2003 decreased by $200 million as compared to the end of  38      fiscal 2002 due primarily to the current year reclassification of the Company's long-term debt as a current obligation resulting from its scheduled maturity in February 2004.  The primary sources of total cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2003 were $289 million in cash generated by operating activities and $53 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by $164 million utilized for capital expenditures and $26 million for the repurchase of common stock.  The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt obligations, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.  Debt   The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $4 million of unamortized deferred gains on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of September 27, 2003. The Company currently anticipates utilizing its existing cash balances to settle these notes when due.  Capital Expenditures   The Company's total capital expenditures were $164 million during fiscal 2003, $92 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Company's Retail segment and $72 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $160 million for capital expenditures during 2004, approximately $85 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Company's Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure.  Stock Repurchase Plan   In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.  During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was still authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 27, 2003.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.  39     Lease Commitments   As of September 27, 2003, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $600 million, $354 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Company's existing operating leases range from 1 to 12 years. Subsequent to September 27, 2003, the Company entered into additional operating lease commitments for retail space with future lease commitments totaling $64 million for periods ranging from 10 to 12 years.  Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers   The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3 months. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $848 million.  Indemnifications   The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition   Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Company's products and the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.   The Company's operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions. For much of the past several years, demand for the Company's products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Company's education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding. Continued uncertainty about future economic conditions continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results. Should global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, demand for the Company's products could continue to be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.  War, terrorism or public health issues could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products which could negatively affect the Company's operations and performance.   War, terrorism or public health issues, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties  40     that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Company's suppliers or customers. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Company's products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to its customers, or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply chain. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these events.  The Company and some of its manufacturing vendors and component suppliers have significant operations in various locations throughout Asia, including locations in mainland China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Singapore, all of which were subject to the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) travel advisories at times during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2003. Similar travel advisories were issued for Taiwan, where a significant amount of the Company's portable Macintosh systems and the iPod are assembled. Should the severity of the SARs threat increase or other public health issues arise, the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company's manufacturing vendors and component suppliers.  The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected.   The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing products. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.  The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Company's competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company's products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Company's markets.  The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing Microsoft's Windows operating systems. The Company's future operating results and financial condition  41      are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms, including Windows.  The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music distribution services, free peer-to-peer music services, emerging companies, and larger companies that may have greater resources, including technical and marketing resources, and supplier relationships. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Company's operating results and financial position.  The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors.   The Company's ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Company's Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Company's brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure.  The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.   Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Company's existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations.  During 2001, the Company introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its first major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. Other major upgrades include Mac OS X Jaguar in 2002 and most recently Mac OS X Panther in October 2003. Inability of the Company to provide additional improvements in the performance and functionality of Mac OS X, advance customer acceptance of the new operating system and its upgrades, obtain the continued commitment of software developers to transition existing applications to run on Mac OS X, or create new applications to run on Mac OS X, may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.  Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.   The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its  42     inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  Future operating results are dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources.   Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and optical and magnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Company's suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Company's results of operations. In addition, currently IBM is the Company's sole supplier of the G5 processor used in current Power Macintosh products and Motorola is the sole supplier of the G4 processors. The inability in the future of the Company to obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  43      The Company relies on third-party music content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.   The Company contracts with third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Company's iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third-party music. Many of the Company's licensing arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their music distribution operations, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or expand its geographic reach outside the United States, then sales and gross margins of the Company's iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected.  Third-party content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse affect on the Company's operating results and financial position.  The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the United States.   Many of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition.  Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company's manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company's products and final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Japan, Taiwan and China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic, business, environmental, medical, political, or military conditions or events, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The Company's products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits.   The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain "bugs" that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third-parties that may be beyond its control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant expense to remedy.  44     The Company's retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.   Through November 2003, the Company has opened 74 retail stores including its first international store in Tokyo, Japan. The Company's retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 15 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment's costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason.  Certain of the Company's stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company's more typical retail stores. The Company has opened four such stores and has one under construction. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  Many of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could adversely affect the Retail segment's future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of the Company's retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the United States; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost.  Unit sales of the Company's professionally oriented desktop systems have declined sharply over the past several years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin.   Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 as compared to 2002 and fell 18% in 2002 from 2001. Power Macintosh unit sales have fallen as a percentage of total Macintosh unit sales from 30% in 2001 to 22% in 2003. The Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary users of such systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Company's current and potential customers, particularly professional and creative customers who are most likely to utilize the Company's Power Macintosh systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. In addition to the negative impact on net sales, declining sales of Power Macintosh systems also have a negative effect on the Company's overall gross margin because Power Macintosh systems generally have higher individual gross margins than the Company's other Macintosh systems. Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales could adversely affect the Company's future net sales and gross margin. If future unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fail to  45     partially or fully recover, it will be difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability. While the Company has introduced faster Power Macintosh systems utilizing 64-bit PowerPC G5 processors during 2003, there can be no assurance that introduction of such systems will favorably impact net sales either in the short or long term.  The Company faces increasing competition in the U.S. education market.   Sales in the United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university customers, remain a core market for Apple. Net sales in these markets fell to 18% of the Company's total net sales in 2003 from 21% and 26% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The drop in 2003 reflects declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales in these markets of 4% and 6%, respectively, in fiscal 2003 compared to 2002. Additionally, several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers, which could also negatively affect the Company's market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue 1:1 learning solutions in education. These 1:1 solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.  The Company's future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products.   The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world. The Company also sells its own products and certain third-party products through its retail stores. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company employees. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment.  Over the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Company's net sales have been made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the United States. Some of the Company's resellers have perceived this expansion of the Company's direct sales as conflicting with their own business and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Company's products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Company's resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Company's products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Company's products. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Company's products.  Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Markets and Distribution," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  46      The Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.   A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the Company's results of operations.  Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions, and interest rate swap and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates.  Further information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  The Company's future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Company's hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.   The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's operating system, on a timely basis or at all.  In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company's products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence  47      the decision of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database management, and high-quality presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application.  In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and results of operations. In June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac OS. Microsoft's decision to discontinue development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X appears to have been influenced in part by the Company's introduction during 2003 of its own web browser, Safari. It is unclear what impact, if any, Microsoft's decision to cease further development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X will have on the Company. However, if customers chose not to purchase the Company's products because Internet Explorer is not available on the Macintosh platform or should websites fail to provide support for web browsers other than Internet Explorer, the Company's net sales and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The Company's business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.   Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms.  Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in  48      Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.   The Company's profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that period's net sales.  The typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the Company's fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Company's business and operating results.   The Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition.  The Company's success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.   Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company's employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Company's future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel.  The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.   The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost.  Business interruptions could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   The Company's major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. The Company's operating results and financial  49     condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.  Failure of the Company's information technology systems and breaches in the security of data could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company's ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns by its implementation of sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.  The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen.   The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.  The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.   Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan and California. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial position.  Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.   Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting regulations can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business.  Unanticipated changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results.   The Company's future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes  50     resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition.  The Company's stock price may be volatile.   The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive performance in the Company's stock price, as well as general economic and political conditions and investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's stock in the future.  The Company's acquisition activity could disrupt its ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transaction.   The Company has acquired and may continue to acquire companies that have products, services, personnel and technologies that complement the Company's strategic direction and product roadmap. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in incorporating the acquired companies' operations and technologies; distraction of management's attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with acquisition; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company's due diligence process, including product quality issues and legal contingencies. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that the Company's previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect business, operating results or financial condition. The Company has generally paid cash for its acquisitions. Should the Company issue its common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders' percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted.  51         Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management   To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non-hedge portfolios, the Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial position. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 as of October 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income.  Interest Rate Risk   While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company's fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Company's investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process.  During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 and 5 years. As of September 28, 2002, $1.087 billion of the Company's investment portfolio classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management of the Company's investment portfolio, the Company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002.  52      In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 27, 2003, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $12.9 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 28, 2002, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $37.7 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Company's policy is to hold investments to maturity.  The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company entered into no interest rate asset swaps during 2003 or 2002 and had no open interest rate asset swaps at September 27, 2003.  In prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of $6 million. During 2001 the Company closed out all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2002 and 2001 were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and are being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  Foreign Currency Risk   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, generally benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries.  In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign  53      exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $7.5 million as of September 27, 2003 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $3.8 million as of September 28, 2002. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.  Actual gains and losses in the future associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27, 2003 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual exposures and positions.  54             Item 8.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Apple Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, peripherals and personal computing and communicating solutions. The Company's products include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the Mac OS X operating system, the iPod digital music player, and a portfolio of software products and peripherals for education, creative, consumer and business customers. The Company sells its products through its online stores, direct sales force, third-party wholesalers and resellers, and its own retail stores.  Basis of Presentation and Preparation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Typically, the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar.  Financial Instruments   Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments   The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.  Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments   The Company has made investments in non-current debt and equity investments of public and privately held companies that have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long-term assets within other assets. They are not categorized as current assets either because, given their nature, they are not readily convertible into cash or because they represent potentially longer-term investments by the Company. Further, the fair value of these investments has been subject to a high degree of volatility. The Company's non-current debt and equity investments have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. However, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense. Occasionally, the Company uses short-term equity derivatives to  60     manage potential dispositions of non-current debt and equity investments. Any gains or losses associated with such derivatives are recognized currently in other income and expense.  Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity   On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150,  Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment related to a forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003, which resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million representing the increase in fair value of the agreement from June 29, 2003 through the settlement date.  Derivative Financial Instruments   On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of approximately $12 million, all of which was reclassified to earnings during 2001. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income.  For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current  61      earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period.  For foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. For interest rate swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133.  Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.  Property, Plant, and Equipment   Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years.  Asset Retirement Obligations   On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. All of the Company's existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of September 29, 2002, gross expected future cash flows of $9.5 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.  62     As of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements. This amount represents the present value of expected future cash flows associated with returning certain of the Company's leased properties to original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow of $9.5 million and its present value of $6 million at September 29, 2002, is being accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of 2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.  The following table reconciles changes in the Company's asset retirement liability for fiscal 2003 (in millions):     Asset retirement liability recorded at September 29, 2002   $ 5.5     Additional asset retirement obligations recognized     0.5     Accretion recognized     1.2          Asset retirement liability as of September 27, 2003   $ 7.2           Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets   The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 27, 2003, the Company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets, except those made in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2001, and its annual goodwill impairment tests at August 30, 2003 and August 30, 2002, respectively, and found no impairment. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.  SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.  Foreign Currency Translation   The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and  63     expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations.  Revenue Recognition   Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed and determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable.  Revenue from extended warranty and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty and support periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, certain repairs, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the Company's one-year basic limited parts and labor warranty.  The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at the gross amount billed.  Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of each element. Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. VSOE is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold separately.  The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience.  64      Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. However, a limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.  Shipping Costs   The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented.  Warranty Expense   The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.  Research and Development   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named "Panther"), which enhances the features and functionality of the previous version of Mac OS X, subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named "Jaguar") subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the fourth quarter of 2002. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth quarter of 2002 when Jaguar was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. In addition, during 2002, the Company also began capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization of approximately $6 million began upon achievement of technological feasibility in the first quarter of 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released in July 2002.  During 2001 the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X, subsequent to release of a public beta version of the product and prior to release of the final product version. As a result, the Company capitalized approximately $5.4 million of development costs during 2001 associated with development of Mac OS X. Related amortization is  65      computed by use of the straight-line method in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 8 year estimated useful life.  Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $5.8 million, $1.2 million and $350,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Advertising Costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $193 million, $209 million, and $261 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Restructuring Charges   In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring) and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities.  Stock-Based Compensation   The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.  As required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in  66     management's opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares.  For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):         2003   2002   2001     Net income (loss)as reported   $ 69   $ 65   $ (25 )    Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income (loss), net of tax      15      5      2     Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards, net of tax     (181 )   (234 )   (373 )                   Net losspro forma   $  (97 ) $  (164 ) $  (396 )                   Net income (loss) per common shareas reported                            Basic   $ 0.19   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 )     Diluted   $ 0.19   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 )    Net loss per common sharepro forma                            Basic   $ (0.27 ) $ (0.46 ) $ (1.15 )     Diluted   $ (0.27 ) $ (0.46 ) $ (1.15 )    Earnings Per Common Share   Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential shares of common stock related to stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share for fiscal 2001 because their effect would have been antidilutive.  67     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:     For the Years Ended    September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002   September 29, 2001     Numerator (in millions):                         Income (loss) before accounting changes   $ 68   $ 65   $ (37 )     Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of income taxes   $ 1   $    $ 12                      Net income (loss)   $ 69   $ 65   $ (25 )                   Denominator (in thousands):                            Weighted-average shares outstanding     360,631     355,022     345,613       Effect of dilutive options and dilutive restricted stock     2,835     6,763                           Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share     363,466     361,785     345,613                     Basic earnings (loss) per share before accounting changes   $  0.19   $  0.18   $  (0.11 )   Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of tax             $ 0.04                    Basic earnings (loss) per share after accounting changes   $ 0.19   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 )                   Diluted earnings (loss) per share before accounting changes   $  0.19   $  0.18   $  (0.11 )   Cumulative effects of accounting changes, net of tax             $ 0.04                    Diluted earnings (loss) per share after accounting changes   $ 0.19   $ 0.18   $ (0.07 )                   Options to purchase 50.8 million and 58.0 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2003 and 2002, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for that year because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. At September 29, 2001, the Company had options to purchase 97.2 million shares of its common stock outstanding, all of which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for 2001 because the effect would have been antidilutive.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  Segment Information   The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.  68       Note 2Financial Instruments   The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of those instruments.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments   The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's cash and available-for-sale securities held in its short-term investment portfolio, recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002 (in millions):         September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002   Cash   $ 158   $ 161              U.S. Treasury and Agency securities      87      47   U.S. corporate securities     2,368     1,828   Foreign securities     783     216               Total cash equivalents     3,238     2,091              U.S. Treasury and Agency securities      454      674   U.S. corporate securities     623     1,330   Foreign securities     93     81               Total short-term investments     1,170     2,085               Total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments   $ 4,566   $ 4,337              The Company's short-term investment portfolio consists of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. The Company's U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses totaling $1 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year as of September 27, 2003 and net unrealized gains of $20 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, as of September 28, 2002. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. These net gains were included in interest and other income, net.  As of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 27, 2003 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 28, 2002, approximately $1.087 billion of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 28, 2002 had maturities of 3 to 12 months.  Accounts Receivable   Trade Receivables   The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia and by arranging with third-  69     party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from a single customer, Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.3% and 10.8% of net accounts receivable as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively.  The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Beginning allowance balance   $ 51   $ 51   $ 64     Charged to costs and expenses     4     10     7     Deductions (a)     (6 )   (10 )   (20 )                  Ending allowance balance   $ 49   $ 51   $ 51                        (a)Represents amounts written off against the allowance, net of recoveries.   Non-Trade Receivables   The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $184 million and $142 million as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales.  Inventory Prepayment   In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2002. Approximately $53 million of this deposit remained unused as of September 28, 2002 and was reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets. During the first six months of 2003, the remainder of the deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest component. The Company imputed an amount to cost of sales and interest income during each period the deposit was outstanding at a 3.25% interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction.  Derivative Financial Instruments   The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's  70     accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign currency instruments as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002 (in millions):         September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002       Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Notional Principal   Fair Value   Credit Risk Amounts   Foreign exchange instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:                                         Spot/Forward contracts   $ 464   $ (21 ) $    $ 462   $ 1   $ 1     Purchased options   $ 512   $ 3   $ 3   $ 196   $    $      Sold options   $ 645   $ (8 ) $    $ 392   $ (4 ) $     Foreign exchange instruments other than accounting hedges:                                               Spot/Forward contracts   $ 445   $ 3   $ 3   $ 302   $    $      Purchased options   $ 8   $    $    $    $    $      Sold options   $ 5   $    $    $    $    $     The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates.  The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002. In certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.  Foreign Exchange Risk Management   The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  71     In accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For currency forward contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date.  For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.  To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 9 months.  The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. Hedge effectiveness on forwards designated as net investment hedges is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.  As discussed above, the Company enters into foreign currency option contracts as items that provide an offset to the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. All changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts based on changes in option time value are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with  72      such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. During 2002, the Company recorded net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. During 2001, the Company recorded a net gain of $5.1 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003.  Interest Rate Risk Management   The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.  As of September 30, 2000, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2001, the Company closed out all of its existing debt interest rate swap positions due to prevailing market interest rates realizing a gain of $17 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  The unrealized loss on the asset swaps as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment effective on October 1, 2000. The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million.  As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. Due to perceived market risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps in early 2002. The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps during fiscal 2002 until the Company closed out the positions in late 2002 due to prevailing market interest rates. Closing the debt interest rate swaps resulted in a realized gain  73      of $6 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt.  Debt   The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $4 million of related unamortized deferred gains on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of September 27, 2003. As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt interest rate swaps, was $304 million and $316 million, respectively, while the fair value was $302 million and $299 million, respectively. The fair value of the notes is based on their listed market values as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002.  Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses   The Company has held investments in EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in total other income and expense. The combined fair value of these investments held by the Company was $5 million and $39 million as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, respectively.  EarthLink   In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment was in EarthLink's Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Mac customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold in the United States.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Company's carrying value of the shares. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in EarthLink, consisting of 3,960,000 shares of stock for net proceeds of approximately $23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 6.5 million shares of EarthLink stock valued at $35 million.  74      During the second quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary requiring that its cost basis be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down be included in earnings. As a result, the Company recognized a $114 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $86 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 425,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $6 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $800,000, and recognized related income tax of approximately $200,000.  Akamai   In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale.  During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $9 million and a gain before taxes of $8 million. As of September 27, 2003, the Company's remaining investment in Akamai consists of 986,000 shares of Akamai stock valued at $5 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to $3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 2.9 million shares of Akamai stock valued at $3 million.  During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $36 million.  ARM   ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology.  During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in ARM stock, consisting of 278,000 shares for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of $270,000.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 278,000 shares of ARM stock valued at $578,000.  During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $176 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $174 million, and recognized related income tax expense of approximately $52 million.  75        Samsung   During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel display production capacity. The investment was in the form of three year unsecured bonds, which were convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock beginning in July 2000. The bonds carried an annual coupon rate of 2% and paid a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at maturity.  Prior to its sale, the Company had categorized its investment in Samsung as available-for-sale requiring that it be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung was approximately $123 million as of September 30, 2000. With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on October 1, 2000, the Company was required to account for the conversion option embedded in the Samsung bonds separately from the related debt. The conversion feature was carried at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Included in the $17 million gross SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment recorded in earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 was a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to fair value as of October 1, 2000, of the derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung. To adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to fair value as of December 30, 2000, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million during the first quarter of 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company sold this investment for book value, including accrued interest, and received net proceeds of approximately $117 million.  Other Strategic Investments   The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies, which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other assets. These investments were inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies were typically not fully developed. During 2002 and 2001, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of $15 million and $8 million, respectively. These charges were included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the Company had no private debt or equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheets.

The Company ceased amortization of goodwill at the beginning of fiscal 2002 when it adopted SFAS No. 142.  The following table summarizes the components of gross and net intangible asset balances (in millions):         September 27, 2003   September 28, 2002       Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Amount   Gross Carrying Amount   Accumulated Amortization   Net Carrying Amount   Goodwill (a)   $ 85        $ 85   $ 85        $ 85   Other acquired intangible assets     5     (5 )        5     (5 )      Acquired technology     42     (18 )   24     42     (8 )   34                         Total acquired intangible assets   $ 132   $ (23 ) $ 109   $ 132   $ (13 ) $ 119                            (a)Accumulated amortization related to goodwill of $55 million arising prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 has been reflected in the gross carrying amount of goodwill as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002.

During fiscal 2003, contingent consideration totaling $1.3 million was paid. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Emagic is not subject to amortization pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible assets acquired   $ 2.3   Acquired technology     3.8   Tradename     0.8   In-process research and development     0.5   Goodwill     18.6            Total consideration   $ 26.0           79     The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003, included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%.  Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail   During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of $20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent consideration which will be allocated to compensation expense over the next 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that will be amortized over 10 years.  Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC   During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an additional component of the cost of the acquired assets, will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years.  Acquisition of Spruce Technologies, Inc.   In July 2001, the Company acquired Spruce Technologies, Inc. (Spruce), a privately-held company that develops and markets DVD authoring products, for $14.9 million in cash. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Spruce is not subject to amortization pursuant to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Spruce from the date of acquisition. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible liabilities assumed   $ (0.7 )   Identifiable intangible assets     5.9     Goodwill     9.7                Total consideration   $ 14.9               Acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc.   In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and districts that enable schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track  80     their children's progress. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of PowerSchool from the date of acquisition.  The purchase price of approximately $66.1 million consisted of the issuance of approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $61.2 million, the issuance of stock options with a fair value of $4.5 million, and $300,000 of direct transaction costs. The fair value of the common stock options issued was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 67%, expected life of 4 years, dividend rate of 0%, and risk-free rate of 4.73%.  Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):     Net tangible assets acquired   $ 0.2   Deferred stock compensation     12.8   Identifiable intangible assets     2.6   In-process research and development     10.8   Goodwill     39.7            Total consideration   $ 66.1           The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. The acquired intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Deferred stock compensation associated with restricted stock and options is being amortized over the required future vesting period of 3 years.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, an adjustment was made to increase goodwill associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool by $5.9 million due to the identification of previously unidentified loss contingencies that were in existence prior to consummation of the acquisition.  The Company allocated $12.8 million of its purchase consideration for PowerSchool to deferred stock compensation within shareholders' equity. This amount represented the intrinsic value of stock options assumed that vest as future services are provided by employees and related to 445,000 common shares issued contingent on continued employment of certain PowerSchool employee stockholders. Certain PowerSchool employee stockholders were terminated in the first quarter of 2003 resulting in the $5 million recognition of previously deferred stock compensation as part of the Company's first quarter restructuring action. Unamortized PowerSchool related deferred stock compensation of approximately $294,000 remains as of September 27, 2003.  Pro Forma Financial Information   The unaudited pro forma financial information below presents the condensed consolidated financial results of the Company assuming that PowerSchool and Spruce, acquired in 2001, had been acquired at the  81     beginning of 2001 and includes the effect of amortization of goodwill and other acquired identifiable intangible assets from that date. The impact of the charge for IPR&D associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool has been excluded. This pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations that would have been achieved had the acquisitions taken place at the beginning of 2001. Pro forma information follows (in millions, except per share amounts):         2001     Net sales   $ 5,370     Net loss   $ (44 )   Basic loss per common share   $ (0.13 )   Diluted loss per common share   $ (0.13 )    Note 5Restructuring Charges   Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions   The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $26.8 million, nearly all had been spent by the end of 2003, except for approximately $400,000 of severance costs and approximately $4.5 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense.  During the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including $2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees, 92 were terminated prior to the end of 2003.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide, all but one of which were eliminated by the end of 2003.  Closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the  82      Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally in the United States and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.  Except for certain costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities, the Company currently anticipates that all of the remaining accrual for severance costs of approximately $400,000 will be spent by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  The following table summarizes activity associated with restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2003 (in millions):         Employee Severance Benefits   Deferred Compensation Write-off   Asset Impairments   Lease Cancellations   Totals     Total charge   $ 7.4   $ 5.0   $ 7.1   $ 7.3   $ 26.8     Total spending through September 27, 2003     (7.5 )             (2.3 )   (9.8 )   Total non-cash items          (5.0 )   (7.1 )        (12.1 )   Adjustments     0.5               (0.5 )                             Accrual at September 27, 2003   $ 0.4   $    $    $ 4.5   $ 4.9                           Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions   During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million.  During the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled  83      $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000.  The following table summarizes activity associated with restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2002 (in millions):         Employee Severance Benefits   Asset Impairments   Lease and Contract Cancellations   Totals     Total charge   $ 10   $ 8   $ 12   $ 30     Total spending through September 27, 2003     (10 )        (11 )   (21 )   Total non-cash items          (8 )        (8 )   Adjustments               (1 )   (1 )                     Accrual at September 27, 2003   $    $    $    $                         Note 6Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Federal:                         Current   $ 18   $ 12   $ (20 )     Deferred     (7 )   (32 )   (8 )                        11     (20 )   (28 )                  State:                         Current     4     3            Deferred     (11 )   6     (10 )                        (7 )   9     (10 )                  Foreign:                         Current     21     29     21       Deferred     (1 )   4     2                          20     33     23                    Provision for income taxes   $ 24   $ 22   $ (15 )                   84       The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $250 million, $284 million and $363 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. As of September 27, 2003, approximately $2.5 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $822 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):         2003   2002   Deferred tax assets:                 Accounts receivable and inventory reserves   $ 35   $ 32     Accrued liabilities and other reserves     155     126     Basis of capital assets and investments     47     34     Tax losses and credits     204     125     Other     11     11               Total deferred tax assets     452     328   Less valuation allowance     30     30             Net deferred tax assets     422     298             Deferred tax liabilities:                 Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries     398     293     Available-for-sale securities          1               Total deferred tax liabilities     398     294             Net deferred tax asset   $ 24   $ 4              As of September 27, 2003, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $189 million, which expire from 2011 through 2023. A portion of these carryforwards was acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $117 million and which expire between 2004 and 2023. The remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 27, 2003, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax  85      planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.  A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2003, 2002, and 2001) to income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, is as follows (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Computed expected tax (benefit)   $ 32   $ 30   $ (18 )   State taxes, net of federal effect     (4 )   7     (7 )   Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries     (13 )             Nondeductible executive compensation     5     (1 )        Stock repurchase     (2 )             Purchase accounting and asset acquisitions     4     3     10     Change in valuation allowance          (16 )        Research & development credit, net     (7 )   (8 )   (5 )   Nondeductible expenses     6     4     3     Other items     3     3     2                    Provision for (benefit from) income taxes   $ 24   $ 22   $ (15 )                  Effective tax rate     26 %   25 %   30 %    On April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2000 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Note 7Shareholders' Equity   CEO Restricted Stock Award   On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Steven P. Jobs, its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase of 27.5 million shares of the Company's common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 60,000 shares of the Company's common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Company's CEO. The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in control of the Company.  The Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a component of shareholders' equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over the 3-year service/vesting period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Company's  86      common stock on the date of the award. Total amortization of approximately $13 million has been included in selling, general, and administrative expense in 2003 and will continue to be included at approximately $6.2 million per quarter through March 2006. The 5 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.  Stock Repurchase Plan   In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.  During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 27, 2003.  Preferred Stock   In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock ("preferred stock") for $150 million. These shares were convertible by Microsoft after August 5, 2000, into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $8.25 per share. During 2000, 74,250 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares of the Company's common stock. During 2001, the remaining 75,750 preferred shares were converted into 9.2 million shares of the Company's common stock.  Comprehensive Income   Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.  The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities   $ 1   $ 13   $ 30     Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative investments     (16 )   (11 )   4     Cumulative foreign currency translation     (20 )   (51 )   (56 )                  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   $ (35 ) $ (49 ) $ (22 )                   87     The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to available-for-sale securities, net of taxes (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Change in fair value of available-for-sale securities   $ 11   $ (49 ) $ (183 )   Adjustment for net (gains) losses realized and included in net income (loss)     (23 )   32     (84 )                  Change in unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities   $ (12 ) $ (17 ) $ (267 )                   The tax effect related to the change in unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities was $6 million, $10 million, $157 million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The tax effect on the reclassification adjustment for net gains (losses) included in net income (loss) was $(8) million, $10 million and $35 million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives, net of taxes, held by the Company (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Changes in fair value of derivatives   $ (24 ) $ 4   $ 45     Adjustment for net gains realized and included in net income (loss)     19     (19 )   (53 )   Cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133               12                    Change in unrealized gain on derivative instruments   $ (5 ) $ (15 ) $ 4                     The tax effect related to the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 was $(5) as of September 29, 2001. The tax effect related to the changes in fair value of derivatives was $11 million, $(2) million and $(19) million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The tax effect related to derivative gains (losses) reclassified from other comprehensive income was $(7) million, $8 million and $23 million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Note 8Employee Benefit Plans   2003 Employee Stock Option Plan   At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future "repricings" of employee stock options, including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.  1997 Employee Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997  88     Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares, following the completion of an employee stock option exchange program in October 2003.  Employee Stock Option Exchange Program   On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company's common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which would be at least six months plus one day after the exchange options are cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company accepted and cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Company's stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction.  1997 Director Stock Option Plan   In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant.  Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans   Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook and Mr. Fred D. Anderson, have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of Apple stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan   The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company's shareholders also approved an amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 4 million shares. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, 2.1 million, 1.8 million and 1.8 million shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 27, 2003, approximately 4.0 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.  89     Employee Savings Plan   The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($12,000 for calendar year 2003). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $21 million, $19 million, and $17 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Stock Option Activity   A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the years ended September 27, 2003, September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001 follows (option amounts are presented in thousands):     Total options outstanding at September 27, 2003 to purchase approximately 63 million shares do not include options to purchase approximately 6.7 million shares that were issued in October 2003 pursuant to the Exchange Program described above.  90      The options outstanding as of September 27, 2003 have been segregated into six ranges for additional disclosure as follows (option amounts are presented in thousands):     As of September 28, 2002, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 57.9 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $30.85 per share. As of September 29, 2001, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 42.1 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $32.15.  Note 9Stock-Based Compensation   The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Exchange Program have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees. The cancellation of certain of the Company's Chief Executive Officer's options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.  91      The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows:         2003   2002   2001     Expected life of stock options     3.5-4 years     4 years     4 years     Expected life of stock purchases     6 months     6 months     6 months     Interest ratestock options     2.14%-2.45 %   2.90 %   4.90 %   Interest ratestock purchases     1.10%-1.77 %   2.71 %   5.97 %   Volatilitystock options     40%-63 %   64 %   66 %   Volatilitystock purchases     35%-44 %   51 %   90 %   Dividend yields     0     0     0      Weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year   $  6.63   $  10.11   $  10.15     Weighted-average fair value of stock purchases during the year   $ 4.24   $ 6.73   $ 11.15      For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company prior to the third quarter of 2003 have been based solely on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the Company has modified this approach to consider other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock and the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company will continue to monitor these and other relevant factors in developing the expected volatility assumption used to value future awards.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the Company shortened its estimate of the expected life of new options granted to its employees from 4 years to 3.5 years. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. The change in the expected life assumption made during the third quarter of 2003 was the result of the expected impact of shortening the contractual life of new options granted to employees from 10 years to 7 years and changing the vesting provisions of new options granted to employees from 4 year straight-line annual vesting to 4 year straight-line quarterly vesting.  Note 10Commitments and Contingencies   Lease Commitments   The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 15 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 27, 2003, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $600 million, of which $354 million related to leases for retail space.  Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $97 million, $92 million, and $80 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Future minimum lease  92      payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 27, 2003, are as follows (in millions):     Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications   The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future expectations.  The following table reconciles changes in the Company's accrued warranties and related costs (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Beginning accrued warranty and related costs   $ 69   $ 87   $ 108     Cost of warranty claims     (71 )   (79 )   (92 )   Accruals for product warranties     69     61     71                    Ending accrued warranty and related costs   $ 67   $ 69   $ 87                     The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 27, 2003 or September 28, 2002.  93        Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product   Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits, or ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the majority of which occurs in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations.  Contingencies   Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Company's motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiff's claims with prejudice on August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling.  The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers  94      the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions that the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and California. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse affects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.  Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data   The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan. As of September 27, 2003, the Retail segment currently operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except as described below for the Retail segment.  The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment's performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $92 million, $106 million, and $92 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Operating income for all segments except Retail includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.  To assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting that are not included in results of the Company's other segments. First, cost of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Company's standard cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Company's major channel partners in the United States. For the years ended September 27, 2003, September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001 this resulted in the  95      recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $106 million, $52 million, and $4 million, respectively.  Second, the Retail segment includes in its net sales proceeds from sales of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts and also recognizes related cost of sales based on the amount at which such contracts are normally sold to the Company's resellers operating retail stores in the United States. This treatment is consistent with how the Company's major resellers account for the sales and cost of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in the Americas segment's net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $30 million and $20 million, respectively. For the year ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $8 million and $6 million, respectively. These amounts were insignificant in fiscal 2001.  Third, a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high profile retail stores are allocated from the Retail segment to corporate marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses reflects the unique nature of these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements, function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate sales and marketing events, and brand awareness. Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs incurred by one of the Company's more typical retail locations. Stores were open in three such high profile locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago as of September 27, 2003. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these three stores were $6 million and $1 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.  96      Summary information by operating segment follows (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Americas:                         Net sales   $ 3,181   $ 3,131   $ 3,037       Operating income   $ 323   $ 278   $ 128       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 5   $ 4   $ 4       Segment assets(a)   $ 494   $ 395   $ 334      Europe:                            Net sales   $ 1,309   $ 1,251   $ 1,249       Operating income   $ 130   $ 122   $ 68       Depreciation and amortization   $ 4   $ 4   $ 6       Segment assets   $ 252   $ 165   $ 137      Japan:                            Net sales   $ 698   $ 710   $ 713       Operating income   $ 121   $ 140   $ 98       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 3   $ 2   $ 2       Segment assets   $ 130   $ 50   $ 44      Retail:                            Net sales   $ 621   $ 283   $ 19       Operating loss   $ (5 ) $ (22 ) $ (21 )     Depreciation, amortization and accretion(b)   $ 25   $ 16   $ 2       Segment assets(b)   $ 243   $ 141   $ 46      Other Segments(c):                            Net sales   $ 398   $ 367   $ 345       Operating income   $ 51   $ 44   $ 24       Depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 2   $ 2   $ 2       Segment assets   $ 78   $ 67   $ 70         (a)The Americas asset figures do not include fixed assets held in the United States. Such fixed assets are not allocated specifically to the Americas segment and are included in the corporate assets figures below. (b)Retail segment depreciation and asset figures reflect the cost and related depreciation of its retail stores and related infrastructure. Retail store construction-in-progress, which is not subject to depreciation, is reflected in corporate assets. (c)Other Segments consists of Asia-Pacific and FileMaker. Certain amounts in prior fiscal periods related to recent acquisitions and Internet services have been reclassified from Other Segments to the Americas segment to conform to the 2003 presentation.   97         A reconciliation of the Company's segment operating income and assets to the consolidated financial statements follows (in millions):         2003   2002   2001     Segment operating income   $ 620   $ 562   $ 297     Corporate expenses, net     (595 )   (514 )   (630 )   Purchased in-process research and development          (1 )   (11 )   Restructuring costs     (26 )   (30 )                         Consolidated operating income (loss)   $ (1 ) $ 17   $ (344 )                   Segment assets   $  1,197   $  818   $  631     Corporate assets   $ 5,618   $ 5,480   $ 5,390                      Consolidated assets   $ 6,815   $ 6,298   $ 6,021                     Segment depreciation, amortization and accretion   $  39   $  28   $  16     Corporate depreciation, amortization and accretion     74     86     84                      Consolidated depreciation, amortization and accretion   $ 113   $ 114   $ 100                     A large portion of the Company's net sales is derived from its international operations. Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the United States, and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, currency exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2003, 2002 or 2001.  Net sales and long-lived assets related to operations in the United States, Japan, and other foreign countries are as follows (in millions):     98     Information regarding net sales by product is as follows (in millions):        (a)Power Macintosh figures include server sales. (b)Net sales of peripherals and other hardware include sales of iPod, Apple-branded and third-party displays, and other hardware accessories. (c)Net sales of software include sales of Apple-branded operating system and application software and sales of third-party software.   Note 12Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions   During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge was for the cost of the aircraft. The other half represented all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were completed. Of the original $90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed.  In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $404,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2002, the Company recognized a total of $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2001 and 2002. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included by the Company in selling, general, and administrative expenses.  In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise  99      of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid $750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003. The remaining $750,000 is due and payable in May 2004.  Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until September 7, 2003, he also served as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products, including products made by the Company. On September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. MicroWarehouse accounted for 2.4%, 3.3%, and 2.9% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $9.9 million and $20.9 million as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively. The Company has provided what it believes to be an adequate allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Company's secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Company's other resellers. In addition, the Company purchases miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately $2.3 million, $2.9 million, and $3.4 million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Note 13Selected Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)      Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share.  Net income during the fourth and third quarters of 2003 included after-tax net gains related to non-current investments of $5 million and $1 million, respectively. Net income for the fourth quarter also included settlement of the Company's forward purchase agreement resulting in a gain of $6 million and a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment related to the adoption of SFAS 150 of $3 million. Net income (loss)  100      during the second and first quarters of 2003 included restructuring charges, net of tax, of $2 million and $18 million, respectively. Net loss for the first quarter of 2003 included an after-tax unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment for the adoption of SFAS No.143 of $2 million.  Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2002 included the following items, net of tax: the write-down of certain equity investments totaling $49 million; a restructuring charge of $4 million; an in-process research and development charge of approximately $1 million; and the reversal of a portion of a previous executive compensation expense resulting in a favorable impact of $2 million. Net income for the first quarter of 2002 included a restructuring charge, net of tax, of $18 million. Net income during the first quarter of 2002 also included gains, net of tax, of $17 million related to non-current investments.  101             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS      The Board of Directors and Shareholders Apple Computer, Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in 2003, changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002, and changed its method of accounting for hedging activities in 2001.         /s/  KPMG LLP          Mountain View, California October 14, 2003  102            Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure      Not applicable.      Item 9A. Controls and Procedures      Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) were effective as of September 27, 2003 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  There were no significant changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  103         PART III          Item 10.

Mr. York is also a director of Tyco International Ltd. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.  104      Role of the Board; Corporate Governance Matters   It is the paramount duty of the Board of Directors to oversee the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management in the competent and ethical operation of the Company on a day-to-day basis and to assure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served. To satisfy this duty, the directors take a proactive, focused approach to their position, and set standards to ensure that the Company is committed to business success through maintenance of the highest standards of responsibility and ethics.  Members of the Board bring to the Company a wide range of experience, knowledge and judgment. These varied skills mean that good governance depends on far more than a "check the box" approach to standards or procedures. The governance structure in the Company is designed to be a working structure for principled actions, effective decision-making and appropriate monitoring of both compliance and performance. The key practices and procedures of the Board are outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor.  Board Committees   The Board has a standing Compensation Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee ("Nominating Committee") and an Audit and Finance Committee ("Audit Committee").  The Compensation Committee is primarily responsible for reviewing the compensation arrangements for the Company's executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, and for administering the Company's stock option plans. Members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Campbell, Drexler, Gore and Dr. Levinson.  The Nominating Committee assists the Board in identifying qualified individuals to become directors, determines the composition of the Board and its committees, monitors the process to assess Board effectiveness and helps develop and implement the Company's corporate governance guidelines. Members of the Nominating Committee are Messrs. Campbell, Drexler, Gore and Dr. Levinson.  The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing the services performed by the Company's independent auditors and internal audit department, evaluating the Company's accounting policies and its system of internal controls and reviewing significant financial transactions. Consistent with the Nasdaq audit committee structure and membership requirements, the Audit Committee is comprised of three members: Messrs. Campbell, York and Dr. Levinson. Because of Mr. York's affiliation with MicroWarehouse, (see Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions), he is deemed to be a "non-independent" director. As permitted under the Nasdaq requirements, the Board carefully considered Mr. York's affiliation with MicroWarehouse as well as his accounting and financial expertise and determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders that he continue to serve as a member of the Audit Committee. Both Mr. Campbell and Dr. Levinson are independent directors.  The Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees operate under written charters adopted by the Board. These charters are available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor.  Audit Committee Financial Expert   While more than one member of the Company's Audit Committee qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K, Mr. William V. Campbell, the Committee chairperson, is the designated audit committee financial expert. Mr. Campbell is considered "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act.  Code of Ethics   The Company has a code of ethics that applies to all of the Company's employees, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. A copy of this code, "Ethics: The Way We Do Business Worldwide" is available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor and is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company intends to disclose any  105     changes in or waivers from its code of ethics by posting such information on its website or by filing a Form 8-K.  Executive Officers   The following sets forth certain information regarding executive officers of the Company. Information pertaining to Mr. Jobs, who is both a director and an executive officer of the Company, may be found in the section entitled "Directors."  Fred D. Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (age 59), joined the Company in April 1996. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Anderson was Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., a position he held from August 1992 to March 1996. Mr. Anderson also serves as a director of eBay Inc. and E.piphany, Inc.  Timothy D. Cook, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Operations (age 43), joined the Company in February 1998. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Cook held the position of Vice President, Corporate Materials for Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq"). Previous to his work at Compaq, Mr. Cook was the Chief Operating Officer of the Reseller Division at Intelligent Electronics.

Executive Compensation      Information Regarding Executive Compensation   The following table summarizes compensation information for the last three fiscal years for (i) Mr. Jobs, Chief Executive Officer and (ii) the four most highly compensated executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer who were serving as executive officers of the Company at the end of the fiscal year (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers").      SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE           (1)In March 2003, Mr. Jobs voluntarily cancelled all of his outstanding options, excluding those granted to him in his capacity as a director. In March 2003, the Board awarded Mr. Jobs five million restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock which generally vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date. (2)In December 1999, Mr. Jobs was given a special executive bonus for past services as the Company's interim Chief Executive Officer, in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90,000,000. Because the aircraft was transferred to Mr. Jobs in 2001, the amount of approximately $43.5 million paid by the Company during fiscal year 2001 towards the purchase of the plane and the related tax assistance of approximately $40.5 million was reported as income to Mr. Jobs. In fiscal 2002, approximately $2.27 million paid by the Company towards the purchase of the plane and approximately $1.3 million in related tax assistance was reported as income to Mr. Jobs. (3)Consists of matching contributions made by the Company in accordance with the terms of the 401(k) plan.  107        Option Grants in Last Fiscal Year   There were no options granted to the Named Executive Officers during fiscal year 2003.  Options Exercised and Year-End Option Holdings   The following table provides information about stock option exercises by the Named Executive Officers during fiscal year 2003 and stock options held by each of them at fiscal year-end.      AGGREGATED OPTION EXERCISES IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR  AND FISCAL YEAR-END OPTION VALUES           (1)Market value of securities underlying in-the-money options at the end of fiscal year 2003 (based on $20.69 per share, the closing price of Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on September 27, 2003), minus the exercise price. (2)Includes 60,000 options granted to Mr. Jobs in his capacity as a director pursuant to the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan. In March 2003, Mr. Jobs voluntarily cancelled all of his outstanding options, excluding those granted to him in his capacity as a director.   Director Compensation   The form and amount of director compensation is determined by the Board after a review of recommendations made by the Nominating Committee. The current practice of the Board is that a substantial portion of a director's annual retainer be equity-based. In 1998, shareholders approved the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan (the "Director Plan") and 800,000 shares were reserved for issuance thereunder. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company's non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon their initial election to the Board ("Initial Options"). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director's initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock ("Annual Options"). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. As of the end of the fiscal year, there were options for 370,000 shares outstanding under the Director Plan. Since accepting the position of CEO, Mr. Jobs is no longer eligible for grants under the Director Plan. Directors also receive a $50,000 annual retainer paid in quarterly increments. Directors do not receive any additional consideration for serving on committees or as committee chairperson.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation   The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. William V. Campbell, Millard S. Drexler, Albert Gore, Jr. and Dr. Arthur B. Levinson, none of whom are employees of the Company and all of whom are considered "independent" directors under the applicable NASDAQ rules. At the beginning of the fiscal year, Mr. Jerome B. York served on the Committee until his resignation in November 2002 at which time Mr. Drexler was appointed as a member of the Committee. No person who  108     was an employee of the Company in fiscal year 2003 served on the Compensation Committee. No executive officer of the Company (i) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, (ii) served as a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, or (iii) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of the Company.      Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management      The following table sets forth certain information as of October 31, 2003 (the "Table Date") with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company's Common Stock by (i) each person the Company believes beneficially holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock; (ii) each director; (iii) each Named Executive Officer listed in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading "Executive Compensation;" and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a group. On the Table Date, 367,490,665 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding. Unless otherwise indicated, all persons named as beneficial owners of Common Stock have sole voting power and sole investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned.      Security Ownership of Directors, Nominees and Executive Officers           (1)Represents shares of Common Stock held and/or options held by such individuals that were exercisable at the Table Date or within 60 days thereafter. (2)Based on a Form 13F-HR filed October 22, 2003 by Lord, Abbett & Co., 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10153. (3)Includes 60,000 shares of Common Stock which Mr. Jobs has the right to acquire by exercise of stock options. (4)Includes 1,150,000 shares of Common Stock which Mr. Anderson has the right to acquire by exercise of stock options. (5)Includes 90,000 shares of Common Stock which Messrs. Campbell and York each have the right to acquire by exercise of stock options.  109      (6)Includes 800,000 shares of Common Stock which Mr. Cook has the right to acquire by exercise of stock options. (7)Includes 70,000 shares of Common Stock which Mr. Drexler has the right to acquire by exercise of stock options. (8)Includes 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock which Mr. Johnson has the right to acquire by exercise of stock options. (9)Includes 1,400 shares of Common Stock which Dr. Levinson holds indirectly and 30,000 shares of Common Stock which Dr. Levinson has the right to acquire by exercise of stock options. (10)Includes 1,600,000 shares of Common Stock which Dr. Tevanian has the right to acquire by exercise of stock options. *Represents less than 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock on the Table Date.  Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance   Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders also are required by rules promulgated by the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based solely upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company or written representations that no Forms 5 were required, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met during fiscal year 2003, except that Messrs. Campbell and York each filed one Form 4 late under the new two-day reporting requirements.  Equity Compensation Plan Information   The following table sets forth certain information, as of September 27, 2003, concerning shares of common stock authorized for issuance under all of the Company's equity compensation plans.         (a) Number of Securities to be Issued Upon Exercise of Options   (b) Weighted Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options   (c) Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a))     Equity compensation plans approved by shareholders   19,507,624   $ 18.75   29,142,907 (1)   Equity compensation plans not approved by shareholders   43,343,560   $ 19.29   20,689,245 (2)                  Total equity compensation plans (3)   62,851,184   $ 19.12   49,832,152 (2)                     (1)This number includes 4,002,123 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 310,000 shares available for issuance under the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan and 24,830,784 shares available for issuance under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan. It does not include shares under the 1990 Stock Option Plan which was terminated in 1997. No new options can be granted under the 1990 Stock Option Plan. (2)On October 22, 2003, the Company granted 6,697,368 shares under the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan") pursuant to the stock option exchange program (see Part II, Item 8 of this  110      Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8, under the heading "Employee Stock Option Exchange Program"). Following that grant, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan, its only non-shareholder approved equity plan. All remaining unissued shares in that plan were cancelled and no new options can be granted under that plan.    (3)This table does not include 160,975 outstanding options assumed in connection with mergers with and acquisitions of the companies which originally established those plans. These assumed options have a weighted average exercise price of $3.69 per share. No additional options may be granted under those assumed plans.  Arrangements with Named Executive Officers   Change In Control ArrangementsStock Options   In the event of a "change in control" of the Company, all outstanding options under the Company's stock option plans, except the Director Plan, will, unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator, become exercisable in full, and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable "change in control price" and the exercise price. The Director Plan provides that upon a "change in control" of the Company, all unvested options held by non-employee directors will automatically become fully vested and exercisable and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable "change in control price" and the exercise price of the options. A "change in control" under these plans is generally defined as (i) the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities or (ii) the occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.  In addition, options granted to the Named Executive Officers generally provide that in the event there is a "change in control," as defined in the Company's stock option plans, and if in connection with or following such "change in control," their employment is terminated without "Cause" or if they should resign for "Good Reason," those options outstanding that are not yet vested and exercisable as of the date of such "change in control" shall become fully vested and exercisable. Generally, "Cause" is defined to include a felony conviction, willful disclosure of confidential information or willful and continued failure to perform his or her employment duties. "Good Reason" includes resignation of employment as a result of a substantial diminution in position or duties, or an adverse change in title or reduction in annual base salary.      Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions      In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Johnson (Senior Vice President, Retail) $1,500,000 for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. The largest amount of the indebtedness outstanding on this loan during fiscal year 2003 was $1,500,000. Mr. Johnson repaid the Company $750,000 during the fiscal year and the amount remaining on the loan is $750,000.  Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. ("MicroWarehouse") in January 2000. Until September 2003, he served as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products, including products made by the Company. During fiscal year 2003, MicroWarehouse accounted for 2.4% of the Company's net sales. The Company also purchased products from MicroWarehouse for its own internal use.  111      In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. During 2003, the Company recognized a total of $403,766 in expenses pursuant to this reimbursement agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2003.      Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services      The following table sets forth the fees paid to the Company's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, during fiscal years 2003 and 2002.      Audit and Non-Audit Fees           (1)Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company's annual financial statements, quarterly review of financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. (2)Audit-related fees include professional services related to the audit of the Company's financial statements, consultation on accounting standards or transactions, and audits of employee benefit plans. (3)Tax fees include $901,500 for professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and preparation relating to the Company's expatriate program, tax audits and international tax compliance; and $115,600 for tax consulting and planning services relating to interest computations and international tax changes. The Company does not engage KPMG to perform personal tax services for its executive officers.   Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Auditors   Prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Act"), the Company adopted an auditor independence policy that banned its auditors from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This auditor policy also mandates that an annual budget for both audit and non-audit services be approved by the Audit Committee in advance, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that no auditor engagements for non-audit services may be entered into without the express approval of the Audit Committee.  112            PART IV          Item 15.
